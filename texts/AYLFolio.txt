SD: Enter +ORLANDO and +ADAM.


+ORLANDO
As I remember Adam, it was vpon this fashion bequeathed me by will, but poore a thousand Crownes, and as thou saist, charged my brother on his blessing to breed mee well: and there begins my sadnesse: My brother Iaques he keepes at schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) staies me heere at home vnkept: for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are bred better, for besides that they are faire with their feeding, they are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders deerely hir'd: but I (his brother) gaine nothing vnder him but growth, for the which his Animals on his dunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this nothing that he so plentifully giues me, the something that nature gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from me: hee lets mee feede with his Hindes, barres mee the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it Adam that grieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke is within mee, begins to mutinie against this seruitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to auoid it.


SD: Enter +OLIUER.


+ADAM
Yonder comes my Master, your brother.


+ORLANDO
Goe a-part Adam, and thou shalt heare how he will shake me vp.


+OLIUER
Now Sir, what make you heere?


+ORLANDO
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.


+OLIUER
What mar you then sir?


+ORLANDO
Marry sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poore vnworthy brother of yours with idlenesse.


+OLIUER
Marry sir be better employed, and be naught a while.


+ORLANDO
Shall I keepe your hogs, and eat huskes with them? what prodigall portion haue I spent, that I should come to such penury?


+OLIUER
Know you where you are sir?


+ORLANDO
O sir, very well: heere in your Orchard.


+OLIUER
Know you before whom sir?


+ORLANDO
I, better then him I am before knowes mee: I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of nations allowes you my better, in that you are the first borne, but the same tradition takes not away my bloud, were there twenty brothers betwixt vs: I haue as much of my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your comming before me is neerer to his reuerence.


+OLIUER
What Boy.


+ORLANDO
Come, come elder brother, you are too yong in this.


+OLIUER
Wilt thou lay hands on me villaine?


+ORLANDO
I am no villaine: I am the yongest sonne of Sir Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice a villaine that saies such a father begot villaines: wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat, till this other had puld out thy tongue for saying so, thou hast raild on thy selfe.


+ADAM
Sweet Masters bee patient, for your Fathers remembrance, be at accord.


+OLIUER
Let me goe I say.


+ORLANDO
I will not till I please: you shall heare mee: my father charg'd you in his will to giue me good education: you haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities: the spirit of my father growes strong in mee, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or giue mee the poore allottery my father left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my fortunes.


+OLIUER
And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent? Well sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you: you shall haue some part of your will, I pray you leaue me.


+ORLANDO
I will no further offend you, then becomes mee for my good.


+OLIUER
Get you with him, you olde dogge.


+ADAM
Is old dogge my reward: most true, I haue lost my teeth in your seruice: God be with my olde master, he would not haue spoke such a word.


SD: +ORLANDO and +ADAM exits


+OLIUER
Is it euen so, begin you to grow vpon me? I will physicke your ranckenesse, and yet giue no thousand crownes neyther: holla Dennis.


SD: Enter +DENNIS.


+DENNIS
Calls your worship?


+OLIUER
Was not Charles the Dukes Wrastler heere to speake with me?


+DENNIS
So please you, he is heere at the doore, and importunes accesse to you.


+OLIUER
Call him in: 'twill be a good way: and to morrow the wrastling is.


SD: Enter +CHARLES.


+CHARLES
Good morrow to your worship.


+OLIUER
Good Mounsier Charles: what's the new newes at the new Court?


+CHARLES
There's no newes at the Court Sir, but the olde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by his yonger brother the new Duke, and three or foure louing Lords haue put themselues into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and reuenues enrich the new Duke, therefore he giues them good leaue to wander.


+OLIUER
Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter bee banished with her Father?


+CHARLES
O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so loues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together, that hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to stay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued of her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two Ladies loued as they doe.


+OLIUER
Where will the old Duke liue?


+CHARLES
They say hee is already in the Forrest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they liue like the old Robin Hood of England: they say many yong Gentlemen flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time carelesly as they did in the golden world.


+OLIUER
What, you wrastle to morrow before the new Duke.


+CHARLES
Marry doe I sir: and I came to acquaint you with a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand, that your yonger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I wrastle for my credit, and hee that escapes me without some broken limbe, shall acquit him well: your brother is but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee loth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if hee come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither to acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he shall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne search, and altogether against my will.


+OLIUER
Charles, I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which thou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had my selfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by vnder-hand meanes laboured to disswade him from it; but he is resolute. Ile tell thee Charles, it is the stubbornest yong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious emulator of euery mans good parts, a secret & villanous contriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse thy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke as his finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie grace himselfe on thee, hee will practise against thee by poyson, entrap thee by some treacherous deuise, and neuer leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some indirect meanes or other: for I assure thee, young, and so villanous this day liuing. I speake but brotherly of him, but should I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I must blush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and wonder.


+CHARLES
I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee goe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and so God keepe your worship.


SD: +CHARLES exits


+OLIUER
Farewell good Charles. Now will I stirre this Gamester: I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet         hee's gentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble deuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my owne people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy thither, which now Ile goe about.

SD: Enter +ROSALIND, and +CELLIA.


+CELIA
I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my Coz, be merry.


+ROSALIND
Deere Cellia; I show more mirth then I am mistresse of, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learne mee how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.


+CELIA
Heerein I see thou lou'st mee not with the full waight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished father had banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou hadst beene still with mee, I could haue taught my loue to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy loue to me were so righteously temper'd, as mine is to thee.


+ROSALIND
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to reioyce in yours.


+CELIA
You know my Father hath no childe, but I, nor none is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou shalt be his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by mine honor I will, and when I breake that oath, let mee turne monster: therefore my sweet Rose, my deare Rose, be merry.


+ROSALIND
From henceforth I will Coz, and deuise sports: let me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue?


+CELIA
Marry I prethee doe, to make sport withall: but loue no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neyther, then with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in honor come off againe.


+ROSALIND
What shall be our sport then?


+CELIA
Let vs sit and mocke the good houswife Fortune from her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee bestowed equally.


+ROSALIND
I would wee could doe so: for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.


+CELIA
'Tis true, for those that she makes faire, she scarce makes honest, & those that she makes honest, she makes very illfauouredly.


+ROSALIND
Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures: Fortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.


SD: Enter +CLOWNE.


+CELIA
No; when Nature hath made a faire creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this foole to cut off the argument?


+ROSALIND
Indeed there is fortune too hard for nature, when fortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off of natures witte.


+CELIA
Peraduenture this is not Fortunes work neither, but Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for our whetstone. for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is the whetstone of the wits. How now Witte, whether wander you?


+CLOWNE
Mistresse, you must come away to your farher.


+CELIA
Were you made the messenger?


+CLOWNE
No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you


+ROSALIND
Where learned you that oath foole?


+CLOWNE
Of a certaine Knight, that swore by his Honour they were good Pan-cakes, and swore by his Honor the Mustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes were naught, and the Mustard was good, and yet was not the Knight forsworne.


+CELIA
How proue you that in the great heape of your knowledge?


+ROSALIND
I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome.


+CLOWNE
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes, and sweare by your beards that I am a knaue.


+CELIA
By our beards (if we had them) thou art.


+CLOWNE
By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if you sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no more was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he neuer had anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before euer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard.


+CELIA
Prethee, who is't that thou means't?


+CLOWNE
One that old Fredericke your Father loues.


+ROSALIND
My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough; speake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one of these daies.


+CLOWNE
The more pittie that fooles may not speak wisely, what Wisemen do foolishly.


+CELIA
By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little wit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that wise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Monsieur the Beu.


SD: Enter +LE BEAU.


+ROSALIND
With his mouth full of newes.


+CELIA
Which he will put on vs, as Pigeons feed their young.


+ROSALIND
Then shal we be newes-cram'd.


+CELIA
All the better: we shalbe the more Marketable. Boon-iour Monsieur le Beu, what's the newes?


+LE BEAU
Faire Princesse, you haue lost much good sport.


+CELIA
Sport: of what colour?


+LE BEAU
What colour Madame? How shall I aunswer you?


+ROSALIND
As wit and fortune will.


+CLOWNE
Or as the destinies decrees.


+CELIA
Well said, that was laid on with a trowell.


+CLOWNE
Nay, if I keepe not my ranke.


+ROSALIND
Thou loosest thy old smell.


+LE BEAU
You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told you of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of.


+ROSALIND
Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling.


+LE BEAU
I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please your Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to performe it.


+CELIA
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.


+LE BEAU
There comes an old man, and his three sons.


+CELIA
I could match this beginning with an old tale.


+LE BEAU
Three proper yong men, of excellent growth and presence.


+ROSALIND
With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto all men by these presents.


+LE BEAU
The eldest of the three, wrastled with Charles the Dukes Wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little hope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so thethird: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father, making such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the beholders take his part with weeping.


+ROSALIND
Alas.


+CLOWNE
But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies haue lost?


+LE BEAU
Why this that I speake of.


+CLOWNE
Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the first time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport for Ladies.


+CELIA
Or I, I promise thee.


+ROSALIND
But is there any else longs to see this broken Musicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin?


+LE BEAU
You must if you stay heere, for heere is the place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to performe it.


+CELIA
Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay and see it.


SD: Flourish. Enter +DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, +ORLANDO, +CHARLES, and Attendants.

Come on, since the youth will not be intreated / His owne perill on his forwardnesse.

Is yonder the man??

Euen he, Madam.


+CELIA
Alas, he is too yong: yet he looks successefully


+DUKE FREDERICK
How now daughter, and Cousin: / Are you crept hither to see the wrastling?


+ROSALIND
I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue.


+DUKE FREDERICK
You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you there is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challengers youth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not bee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can mooue him.


+CELIA
Call him hether good Monsieuer Le Beu.


+DUKE FREDERICK
Do so: Ile not be by.


+LE BEAU
Monsieur the Challenger, the Princesse cals for you.


+ORLANDO
I attend them with all respect and dutie.


+ROSALIND
Young man, haue you challeng'd Charles the Wrastler?


+ORLANDO
No faire Princesse: he is the generall challenger, I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.


+CELIA
Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans strength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew your selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduenture would counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We pray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safetie, and giue ouer this attempt.


+ROSALIND
Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore be misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that the wrastling might not go forward.


+ORLANDO
I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde thoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie so faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your faire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall; wherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was neuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to lament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing: onely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better supplied, when I haue made it emptie.


+ROSALIND
The little strength that I haue, I would it were with you.


+CELIA
And mine to eeke out hers.


+ROSALIND
Fare you well: praie heauen I be deceiu'd in you.


+CELIA
Your hearts desires be with you.


+CHARLES
Come, where is this yong gallant, that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?


+ORLANDO
Readie Sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working.


+DUKE FREDERICK
You shall trie but one fall.


+CHARLES
No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that haue so mightilie perswaded him from a first.


+ORLANDO
You meane to mocke me after: you should not haue mockt me before: but come your waies.


+ROSALIND
Now Hercules, be thy speede yong man.


+CELIA
I would I were inuisible, to catch the strong fellow by the legge.


SD: +ORLANDO, +CHARLES Wrastle.


+ROSALIND
Oh excellent yong man.


+CELIA
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eie, I can tell who should downe.


SD: Shout.


+DUKE FREDERICK
No more, no more.


+ORLANDO
Yes I beseech your Grace, I am not yet well breath'd.


+DUKE FREDERICK
How do'st thou Charles?


+LE BEAU
He cannot speake my Lord.


+DUKE FREDERICK
Beare him awaie: What is thy name yong man?


+ORLANDO
Orlando my Liege, the yongest sonne of Sir Roland de Boys.


+DUKE FREDERICK
I would thou hadst beene son to some man else,
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
But I did finde him still mine enemie:
Thou should'st haue better pleas'd me with this deede,
Hadst thou descended from another house:
But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth,
I would thou had'st told me of another Father.


SD: +DUKE FREDERICK exits


+CELIA
Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this?


+ORLANDO
I am more proud to be Sir Rolands sonne,
His yongest sonne, and would not change that calling
To be adopted heire to Fredricke.


+ROSALIND
My Father lou'd Sir Roland as his soule,
And all the world was of my Fathers minde,
Had I before knowne this yong man his sonne,
I should haue giuen him teares vnto entreaties,
Ere he should thus haue ventur'd.


+CELIA
Gentle Cosen,
Let vs goe thanke him, and encourage him:
My Fathers rough and enuious disposition
Sticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd,
If you doe keepe your promises in loue;
But iustly as you haue exceeded all promise,
Your Mistris shall be happie.


+ROSALIND
Gentleman,
Weare this for me: one out of suites with fortune
That could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes.
Shall we goe Coze?


+CELIA
I: fare you well faire Gentleman.


+ORLANDO
Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts
Are all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp
Is but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke.


+ROSALIND
He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes,
Ile aske him what he would: Did you call Sir?
Sir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne
More then your enemies.


+CELIA
Will you goe Coze?

Haue with you: fare you well.

+LE BEAU
O poore Orlando! thou art ouerthrowne
Or Charles, or something weaker masters thee.


+LE BEAU
Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you
To leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd
High commendation, true applause, and loue;
Yet such is now the Dukes condition,
That he misconsters all that you haue done:
The Duke is humorous, what he is indeede
More suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of.


+ORLANDO
I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this,
Which of the two was daughter of the Duke,
That here was at the Wrastling?


+LE BEAU
Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners,
But yet indeede the taller is his daughter,
The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
And here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle
To keepe his daughter companie, whose loues
Are deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters:
But I can tell you, that of late this Duke
Hath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece,
Grounded vpon no other argument,
But that the people praise her for her vertues,
And pittie her, for her good Fathers sake;
And on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady
Will sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well,
Hereafter in a better world then this,
I shall desire more loue and knowledge of you.


+ORLANDO
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
Thus must I from the smoake into the smother,
From tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother.
But heauenly Rosaline.

Why Cosen, why Rosaline: Cupid haue mercie,
Not a word?


+ROSALIND
Not one to throw at a dog.


+CELIA
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away vpon curs, throw some of them at me; come lame mee with reasons.


+ROSALIND
Then there were two Cosens laid vp, when the one should be lam'd with reasons, and the other mad without any.


+CELIA
But is all this for your Father?


+ROSALIND
No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh how full of briers is this working day world.


+CELIA
They are but burs, Cosen, throwne vpon thee in holiday foolerie, if we walke not in the trodden paths our very petty-coates will catch them.


+ROSALIND
I could shake them off my coate, these burs are in my heart.


+CELIA
Hem them away.


+ROSALIND
I would try if I could cry hem, and haue him.


+CELIA
Come, come, wrastle with thy affections.


+ROSALIND
O they take the part of a better wrastler then my selfe.


+CELIA
O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time in dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice, let vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a sodaine, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Roulands yongest sonne?


+ROSALIND
The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie.


+CELIA
Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his Sonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his father deerely; yet I hate not Orlando.


+ROSALIND
No faith, hate him not for my sake.


+CELIA
Why should I not? doth he not deserue well?


SD: Enter +DUKE FREDERICK with Lords.


+ROSALIND
Let me loue him for that, and do you loue him
Because I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke.

+DUKE FREDERICK
Mistris, dispatch you with your safest haste,
And get you from our Court.


+ROSALIND
Me Vncle.


+DUKE FREDERICK
You Cosen,
Within these ten daies if that thou beest found
So neere our publike Court as twentie miles,
Thou diest for it.


+ROSALIND
I doe beseech your Grace
Let me the knowledge of my fault beare with me:
If with my selfe I hold intelligence,
Or haue acquaintance with mine owne desires,
If that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke,
(As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle,
Neuer so much as in a thought vnborne,
Did I offend your highnesse.


+DUKE FREDERICK
Thus doe all Traitors,
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace it selfe;
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.


+ROSALIND
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor;
Tell me whereon the likelihoods depends?


+DUKE FREDERICK
Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough.


+ROSALIND
So was I when your highnes took his Dukdome,
So was I when your highnesse banisht him;
Treason is not inherited my Lord,
Or if we did deriue it from our friends,
What's that to me, my Father was no Traitor,
Then good my Leige, mistake me not so much,
To thinke my pouertie is treacherous.


+CELIA
Deere Soueraigne heare me speake.


+DUKE FREDERICK
I Celia, we staid her for your sake,
Else had she with her Father rang'd along.


+CELIA
I did not then intreat to haue her stay,
It was your pleasure, and your owne remorse,
I was too yong that time to value her,
But now I know her: if she be a Traitor,
Why so am I: we still haue slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, plaid, eate together,
And wheresoere we went, like Iunos Swans,
Still we went coupled and inseperable.


+DUKE FREDERICK
She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothnes;
Her verie silence, and per patience,
Speake to the people, and they pittie her:
Thou art a foole, she robs thee of thy name,
And thou wilt show more bright, & seem more vertuous
When she is gone: then open not thy lips
Firme, and irreuocable is my doombe,
Which I haue past vpon her, she is banish'd.


+CELIA
Pronounce that sentence then on me my Leige,
I cannot liue out of her companie.


+DUKE FREDERICK
You are a foole: you Neice prouide your selfe,
If you out-stay the time, vpon mine honor,
And in the greatnesse of my word you die.


SD: Exit +DUKE FREDERICK, &c.


+CELIA
O my poore Rosaline, whether wilt thou goe?
Wilt thou change Fathers? I will giue thee mine:
I charge thee be not thou more grieu'd then I am.


+ROSALIND
I haue more cause.


+CELIA
Thou hast not Cosen,
Prethee be cheerefull; know'st thou not the Duke
Hath banish'd me his daughter?


+ROSALIND
That he hath not.


+CELIA
No, hath not? Rosaline lacks then the loue
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one,
Shall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle?
No, let my Father seeke another heire:
Therefore deuise with me how we may flie
Whether to goe, and what to beare with vs,
And doe not seeke to take your change vpon you,
To beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out:
For by this heauen, now at our sorrowes pale;
Say what thou canst, Ile goe along with thee.


+ROSALIND
Why, whether shall we goe?


+CELIA
To seeke my Vncle in the Forrest of Arden.


+ROSALIND
Alas, what danger will it be to vs,
(Maides as we are) to trauell forth so farre?
Beautie prouoketh theeues sooner then gold.


+CELIA
Ile put my selfe in poore and meane attire,
And with a kinde of vmber smirch my face,
The like doe you, so shall we passe along,
And neuer stir assailants.


+ROSALIND
Were it not better,
Because that I am more then common tall,
That I did suite me all points like a man,
A gallant curtelax vpon my thigh,
A bore-speare in my hand, and in my heart
Lye there what hidden womans feare there will,
Weele haue a swashing and a marshall outside,
As manie other mannish cowards haue,
That doe outface it with their semblances.


+CELIA
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?


+ROSALIND
Ile haue no worse a name then Ioues owne Page,
And therefore looke you call me Ganimed.
But what will you be call'd?


+CELIA
Something that hath a reference to my state:
No longer Celia, but Aliena.


+ROSALIND
But Cosen, what if we assaid to steale
The clownish Foole out of your Fathers Court:
Would he not be a comfort to our trauaile?


+CELIA
Heele goe along ore the wide world with me,
Leaue me alone to woe him; Let's away
And get our Iewels and our wealth together,
Deuise the fittest time, and safest way
To hide vs from pursuite that will be made
After my flight: now goe in we content
To libertie, and not to banishment.

SD: Enter +DUKE SENIOR: +AMYENS, and two or three Lords like Forresters {+FIRST LORD OF SENIOR'S, +SECOND LORD OF SENIOR'S}.


+DUKE SENIOR
Now my Coe-mates, and brothers in exile:
Hath not old custome made this life more sweete
Then that of painted pompe? Are not these woods
More free from perill then the enuious Court?
Heere feele we not the penaltie of Adam,
The seasons difference, as the Icie phange
And churlish chiding of the winters winde,
Which when it bites and blowes vpon my body
Euen till I shrinke with cold, I smile, and say
This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly perswade me what I am:
Sweet are the vses of aduersitie
Which like the toad, ougly and venemous,
Weares yet a precious Iewell in his head:
And this our life exempt from publike haunt,
Findes tongues in trees, bookes in the running brookes,
Sermons in stones, and good in euery thing.


+AMYENS
I would not change it, happy is your Grace
That can translate the stubbornnesse of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a stile.


+DUKE SENIOR
Come, shall we goe and kill vs venison?
And yet it irkes me the poore dapled fooles
Being natiue Burgers of this desert City,
Should intheir owne confines with forked heads
Haue their round hanches goard.


+FIRST LORD OF SENIOR'S
Indeed my Lord
The melancholy Iaques grieues at that,
And in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe
Then doth your brother that hath banish'd you:
To day my Lord of Amiens, and my selfe,
Did steale behinde him as he lay along
Vnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes out
Vpon the brooke that brawles along this wood,
To the which place a poore sequestred Stag
That from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt,
Did come to languish; and indeed my Lord
The wretched annimall heau'd forth such groanes
That their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round teares
Cours'd one another downe his innocent nose
In pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole,
Much marked of the melancholie Iaques,
Stood on th'extremest verge of the swift brooke,
Augmenting it with teares.


+DUKE SENIOR
But what said Iaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?


+FIRST LORD OF SENIOR'S
O yes, into a thousand similies.
First, for his weeping into the needlesse streame;
Poore Deere quoth he, thou mak'st a testament
As worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more
To that which had too must: then being there alone,
Left and abandoned of his veluet friend;
'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part
The Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard
Full of the pasture, iumps along by him
And neuer staies to greet him: I quoth Iaques,
Sweepe on you fat and greazie Citizens,
'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you looke
Vpon that poore and broken bankrupt there?
Thus most inuectiuely he pierceth through
The body of Countrie, Citie, Court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Are meere vsurpers, tyrants, and whats worse
To fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp
In their assign'd and natiue dwelling place.


+DUKE SENIOR
And did you leaue him in this contemplation?


+SECOND LORD OF SENIOR'S
We did my Lord, weeping and commenting
Vpon the sobbing Deere.


+DUKE SENIOR
Show me the place,
I loue to cope him in these sullen fits,
For then he's full of matter.


+FIRST LORD OF SENIOR'S
Ile bring you to him strait.

Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be, some villaines of my Court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.


+FIRST LORD OF FREDERICK'S
I cannot heare of any that did see her,
The Ladies her attendants of her chamber
Saw her a bed, and in the morning early,
They found the bed vntreasur'd of their Mistris.


+SECOND LORD OF FREDERICK'S
My Lord, the roynish Clown, at whom so oft,
Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing,
Hisperia the Princesse Centlewoman
Confesses that she secretly ore-heard
Your daughter and her Cosen much commend
The parts and graces of the Wrastler
That did but lately foile the synowie Charles,
And she beleeues where euer they are gone
That youth is surely in their companie.


+DUKE FREDERICK
Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither,
If he be absent, bring his Brother to me,
Ile make him finde him: do this sodainly;
And let not search and inquisition quaile,
To bring againe these foolish runawaies.

+ORLANDO
Who's there?


+ADAM
What my yong Master, oh my gentle master,
Oh my sweet master, O you memorie
Of old Sir Rowland; why, what make you here?
Why are you vertuous? Why do people loue you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to ouercome
The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not Master, to seeme kinde of men,
Their graces serue them but as enemies,
No more doe yours: your vertues gentle Master
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you:
Oh what a world is this, when what is comely
Enuenoms him that beares it?


+ORLANDO
Why, what's the matter?


+ADAM
O vnhappie youth,
Come not within these doores: within this roofe
The enemie of all your graces liues
Your brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne
(Yet not the son, I will not call him son)
Of him I was about to call his Father,
Hath heard your praises, and this night he meanes,
To burne the lodging where you vse to lye,
And you within it: if he faile of that
He will haue other meanes to cut you off;
I ouerheard him: and his practises:
This is no place, this house is but a butcherie;
Abhorre it, feare it, doe not enter it.


+ORLANDO
Why whether Adam would'st thou haue me go?


+ADAM
No matter whether, so you come not here.


+ORLANDO
What, would'st thou haue me go & beg my food,
Or with a base and boistrous Sword enforce
A theeuish liuing on the common rode?
This I must do, or know not what to do:
Yet this I will not do, do how I can,
I rather will subiect me to the malice
Of a diuerted blood, and bloudie brother.


+ADAM
But do not so: I haue fiue hundred Crownes,
The thriftie hire I saued vnder your Father,
Which I did store to be my foster Nurse,
When seruice should in my old limbs lie lame,
And vnregarded age in corners throwne,
Take that, and he that doth the Rauens feede,
Yea prouidently caters for the Sparrow,
Be comfort to my age: here is the gold,
All this I giue you, let me be your seruant,
Though I looke old, yet I am strong and lustie;
For in my youth I neuer did apply
Hot, and rebellious liquors in my bloud,
Nor did not with vnbashfull forehead woe,
The meanes of weaknesse and debilitie,
Therefore my age is as a lustie winter,
Frostie, but kindely; let me goe with you,
Ile doe the seruice of a yonger man
In all your businesse and necessities.


+ORLANDO
Oh good old man, how well in thee appeares
The constant seruice of the antique world,
When seruice sweate for dutie, not for meede:
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweate, but for promotion,
And hauing that do choake their seruice vp,
Euen with the hauing, it is not so with thee:
But poore old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree,
That cannot so much as a blossome yeelde,
In lieu of all thy paines and husbandrie,
But come thy waies, weele goe along together,
And ere we haue thy youthfull wages spent,
Weele light vpon some setled low content.


+ADAM
Master goe on, and I will follow thee
To the last gaspe with truth and loyaltie,
From seauentie yeeres, till now almost fourescore
Here liued I, but now liue here no more
At seauenteene yeeres, many their fortunes seeke
But at fourescore, it is too late a weeke,
Yet fortune cannot recompence me better
Then to die well, and not my Masters debter.

O Iupiter, how merry are my spirits?


+CLOWNE
I care not for my spirits, if my legges were not wearie.


+ROSALIND
I could finde in my heart to disgrace my mans apparell, and to cry like a woman: but I must comfort the weaker vessell, as doublet and hose ought to show it selfe coragious to petty-coate; therefore courage, good Aliena. 


+CELIA
I pray you beare with me, I cannot goe no further.


+CLOWNE
For my part, I had rather beare with you, then beare you: yet I should beare no crosse if I did beare you, for I thinke you haue no money in your purse.


+ROSALIND
Well, this is the Forrest of Arden.

That is the way to make her scorne you still.


+SILUIUS
Oh Corin, that thou knew'st how I do loue her.


+CORIN
I partly guesse: for I haue lou'd ere now.


+SILUIUS
No Corin, being old, thou canst not guesse,
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a louer
As euer sigh'd vpon a midnight pillow:
But if thy loue were euer like to mine,
As sure I thinke did neuer man loue so:
How many actions most ridiculous,
Hast thou beene drawne to by thy fantasie?


+CORIN
Into a thousand that I haue forgotten.


+SILUIUS
Oh thou didst then neuer loue so hartily,
If thou remembrest not the slightest folly,
That euer loue did make thee run into,
Thou hast not lou'd.
Or if thou hast not sat as I doe now,
Wearing thy hearer in thy Mistris praise,
Thou hast not lou'd.
Or if thou hast not broke from companie,
Abruptly as my passion now makes me,
Thou hast not lou'd.
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe.


SD: +SILUIUS exits.


+ROSALIND
Alas poore Shepheard searching of they would,
I haue by hard aduenture found mine owne.


+CLOWNE
And I mine: I remember when I was in loue, I broke my sword vpon a stone, and bid him take that for comming a night to Iane Smile, and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the Cowes dugs that her prettie chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooke two cods, and giuing her them againe, said with weeping teares, weare these for my sake: wee that are true Louers, runne into strange capers; but as all is mortall in nature, so is all nature in loue, mortall in folly.


+ROSALIND
Thou speak'st wiser then thou art ware of.


+CLOWNE
Nay, I shall nere be ware of mine owne wit, till I breake my shins against it.


+ROSALIND
Ioue, Ioue, this Shepherds passion,
Is much vpon my fashion.


+CLOWNE
And mine, but it growes something stale with mee.


+CELIA
I pray you, one of you question yon'd man,
If he for gold will giue vs any foode,
I faint almost to death.


+CLOWNE
Holla; you Clowne.


+ROSALIND
Peace foole, he's not thy kinsman.


+CORIN
Who cals?


+CLOWNE
Your betters Sir.


+CORIN
Else are they very wretched.


+ROSALIND
Peace I say; good euen to your friend.


+CORIN
And to you gentle Sir, and to you all.


+ROSALIND
I prethee Shepheard, if that loue or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring vs where we may rest our selues, and feed:
Here's a yong maid with trauaile much oppressed,
And faints for succour.


+CORIN
Faire Sir, I pittie her,
And wish for her sake more then for mine owne,
My fortunes were more able to releeue her:
But I am shepheard to another man,
And do not sheere the Fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition,
And little wreakes to finde the way to heauen
By doing deeds of hospitalitie.
Besides his Coate, his Flockes, and bounds of feede
Are now on sale, and at our sheep-coat now
By reason of his absence there is nothing
That you will feed on: but what is, come see,
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.


+ROSALIND
What is he that shall buy his flocke and pasture?


+CORIN
That yong Swaine that you saw heere but erewhile,
That little cares for buying any thing.


+ROSALIND
I pray thee, if it stand with honestie,
Buy thou the Cottage, pasture, and the flocke,
And thou shalt haue to pay for it of vs.


+CELIA
And we will mend thy wages: / I like this place, and willingly could / Waste my time in it.


+CORIN
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me, if you like vpon report,
The soile, the profit, and this kinde of life,
I will your very faithfull Feeder be,
And buy it with your Gold right sodainly.

Well then, if euer I thanke any man, Ile thanke you: but that they cal complement is like th'encounter of two dog-Apes. And when a man thankes me hartily, me thinkes I haue giuen him a penie, and he renders me the beggerly thankes. Come sing; and you that wil not hold your tongues.

Heere was he merry, hearing of a Song.

That your poore friends must woe your companie,
What, you looke merrily.


+IAQUES
A Foole, a foole: I met a foole i'th Forrest,
A motley Foole (a miserable world:)
As I do liue by foode, I met a foole,
Who laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun,
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes,
In good set termes, and yet a motley foole.
Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he,        
Call me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune,
And then he drew a diall from his poake,
And looking on it, with lacke-lustre eye,
Sayes, very wisely, it is ten a clocke:
Thus we may see (quoth he) how the world wagges:
'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine,
And after one houre more, 'twill be eleuen,
And so from houre to houre, we ripe, and ripe,
And then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot,
And thereby hangs a tale. When I did heare
The motley Foole, thus morall on the time,
My Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere,
That Fooles should be so deepe contemplatiue:
And I did laugh, sans intermission
An houre by his diall. Oh noble foole,
A worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare.


+DUKE SENIOR
What foole is this?


+IAQUES
O worthie Foole: One that hath bin a Courtier
And sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire,
They haue the gift to know it: and in his braiue,
Which is as drie as the remainder bisket
After a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd
With obseruation, the which he vents
In mangled formes. O that I were a foole,
I am ambitious for a motley coat.


+DUKE SENIOR
Thou shalt haue one.


+IAQUES
It is my onely suite,
Prouided that you weed your better iudgements
Of all opinion that growes ranke in them,
That I am wise. I must haue liberty
Wiithall, as large a Charter as the winde,
To blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue:
And they that are most gauled with my folly,
They most must laugh: And why sir must they so?
The why is plaine, as way to Parish Church:
Hee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit,
Doth very foolishly, although he smart
Seeme senselesse of the bob. If not,
The Wise-mans folly is anathomiz'd
Euen by the squandring glances of the foole.
Inuest me in my motley: Giue me leaue
To speake my minde, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foule bodie of th'infected world,
If they will patiently receiue my medicine.


+DUKE SENIOR
Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do.


+IAQUES
What, for a Counter, would I do, but good?


+DUKE SENIOR
Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine,
As sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe,

Why who cries out on pride,
That can therein taxe any priuate party:
Doth it not flow as hugely as the Sea,
Till that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe.
What woman in the Citie do I name,
When that I say the City woman beares
The cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders?
Who can come in, and say that I meane her,
When such a one as shee, such is her neighbor?
Or what is he of basest function,
That sayes his brauerie is not on my cost,
Thinking that I meane him, but therein suites
His folly to the mettle of my speech,
There then, how then, what then, let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free,
why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies
Vnclaim'd of any. man But who come here?

Of bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew

I thought that all things had bin sauage heere,
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of sterne command'ment. But what ere you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Vnder the shade of melancholly boughes,
Loose, and neglect the creeping houres of time:
If euer you haue look'd on better dayes:
If euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church:
If euer sate at any good mans feast:
If euer from your eye-lids wip'd a teare,
And know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied:
Let gentlenesse my strong enforcement be,
In the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword.

True is it, that we haue seene better dayes,
And haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church,
And sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies
Of drops, that sacred pity hath engendred:
And therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse,
And take vpon command, what helpe we haue
That to your wanting may be ministred.

Whiles (like a Doe) I go to finde my Fawne,
And giue it food. There is an old poore man,

Opprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger,

Wherein we play in.


+IAQUES
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women, meerely Players;
They haue their Exits and their Entrances,
And one man in his time playes many parts,
His Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant,
Mewling, and puking in the Nurses armes:
Then, the whining Schoole-boy with his Satchell
And shining morning face, creeping like snaile
Vnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer,
Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad
Made to his Mistresse eye-brow. Then, a Soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard,
Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell,
Seeking the bubble Reputation
Euen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice
In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd,
With eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut,
Full of wise sawes, and moderne instances,
And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts
Into the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,
His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide,
For his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice,
Turning againe toward childish trebble pipes,
And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all,
That ends this strange euentfull historie,
Is second childishnesse, and meere obliuion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.

Freize, freize, thou bitter skie

And how like you this shepherds life Mr Touchstone?


+CLOWNE
Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well: but in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in respect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no more plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke. Has't any Philosophie in thee shepheard?


+CORIN
No more, but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money, meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That pood pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath learned no wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.


+CLOWNE
Such a one is a naturall Philosopher: Was't euer in Court, Shepheard?


+CORIN
No truly.


+CLOWNE
Then thou art damn'd.


+CORIN
Nay, I hope.


+CLOWNE
Truly thou art damn'd, like an ill roasted Egge, all on one side.


+CORIN
For not being at Court? your reason.


+CLOWNE
Why, if thou neuer was't at Court, thou neuer saw'st good manners: if thou neuer saw'st good maners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickednes is sin, and sinne is damnation: Thou art in a parlous state shepheard.


+CORIN
Not a whit Touchstone, those that are good maners at the Court, are as ridiculous in the Countrey, as the behauiour of the Countrie is most mockeable at the Court. You told me, you salute not at the Court, but you kisse your hands; that courtesie would be vncleanlie if Courtiers were shepheards.


+CLOWNE
Instance, briefly: come, instance.


+CORIN
Why we are still handling our Ewes, and their Fels you know are greasie.


+CLOWNE
Why do not your Courtiers hands sweate? and is not the grease of a Mutton, as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow: A better instance I say: Come.


+CORIN
Besides, our hands are hard.


+CLOWNE
Your lips wil feele them the sooner. Shallow agen: a more sounder instance, come.


+CORIN
And they are often tarr'd ouer, with the surgery of our sheepe: and would you haue vs kisse Tarre? The Courtiers hands are perfum'd with Ciuet.


+CLOWNE
Most shallow man: Thou wormes meate in respect of a good peece of flesh indeed: learne of the wise and perpend: Ciuet is of a baser birth then Tarre, the verie vncleanly fluxe of a Cat. Mend the instance Shepheard.


+CORIN
You haue too Courtly a wit, for me, Ile rest.


+CLOWNE
Wilt thou rest damn'd? God helpe thee shallow man: God make incision in thee, thou art raw.


+CORIN
Sir, I am a true Labourer, I earne that I eate: get that I weare; owe no man hate, enuie no mans happinesse: glad of other mens good content with my harme: and the greatest of my pride, is to see my Ewes graze, & my Lambes sucke.


+CLOWNE
That is another simple sinne in you, to bring the Ewes and the Rammes together, and to offer to get your liuing, by the copulation of Cattle, to be bawd to a Belweather, and to betray a shee-Lambe of a tweluemonth to a crooked-pated olde Cuckoldly Ramme, out of all reasonable
match. If thou bee'st not damn'd for this, the diuell himselfe will haue no shepherds, I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.

*Why should this Desert bee,

Tonges Ile hang on euerie tree,

Some, how briefe the Life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage,
That the stretching of a span,
buckles in his summe of age.
Some of violated vowes,
twixt the soules of friend, and friend:
But vpon the fairest bowes,
or at euerie sentence end;
Will I Rosalinda write,
teaching all that reade, to know
The quintessence of euerie sprite,
heauen would in little show.
Therefore heauen Nature charg'd,
that one bodie shonld be fill'd
With all Graces wide enlarg'd,
nature presently distill'd
Helens cheeke, but not his heart,
Cleopatra's Maiestie:
Attalanta's better part,
sad Lucrecia's Modestie.
Thus Rosalinde of manie parts,
by Heauenly Synode was deuis'd,
Of manie faces, eyes, and hearts,
to haue the touches deerest pris'd.
Heauen would that shee these gifts should haue,
and I to liue and die her slaue.*

That's no matter: the feet might beare ye verses.

I, but the feet were lame, and could not beare themselues without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.

But didst thou heare without wondering, how thy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees?

Good my complection, dost thou think though I am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South-sea of discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and speake apace: I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might'st powre this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as Wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle: either too much at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke out of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings.

Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else sighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold detect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke.


+ORLANDO
And why not the swift foote of time? Had not that bin as proper?


+ROSALIND
By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces, with diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles withall, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands stil withall.


+ORLANDO
I prethee, who doth he trot withal?


+ROSALIND
Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between the contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd: if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard, that it seemes the length of seuen yeare.


+ORLANDO
Who ambles Time withal?


+ROSALIND
With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man that hath not the Gowt : for the one sleepes easily because he cannot study, and the other liues merrily, because he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of leane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no burthen of heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles withal.


+ORLANDO
Who doth he gallop withal?


+ROSALIND
With a theefe to the gallowes : for though hee go as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon there.


+ORLANDO
Who staies it stil withal?


+ROSALIND
With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe betweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not how time moues.


+ORLANDO
Where dwel you prettie youth?

With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the skirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat.

As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is kindled.


+ORLANDO
Your accent is something finer, then you could purchase in so remoued a dwelling.


+ROSALIND
I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an olde religious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too well: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read many Lectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Woman to be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.


+ORLANDO
Can you remember any of the principall euils, that he laid to the charge of women?


+ROSALIND
There were none principal, they were all like one another, as halfe pence are, euerie one fault seeming monstrous, til his fellow-fault came to match it.


+ORLANDO
I prethee recount some of them.


+ROSALIND
No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those that are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that abuses our yong plants with caruing Rosalinde on their barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on brambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of Rosalinde. If I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him some good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian of Loue vpon him.


+ORLANDO
I am he that is so Loue-shak'd, I pray you tel me your remedie.


+ROSALIND
There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you: he taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage of rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner.


+ORLANDO
What were his markes?


+ROSALIND
A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie and sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spirit, which you haue not: a beard neglected, which you haue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your hauing in beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your hose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your sleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing about you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you are no such man; you are rather point deuice in your accoustrements, as louing your selfe, then seeming the Louer of any other.


+ORLANDO
Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue I Loue.


+ROSALIND
Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that you Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do, then to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the which women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the Trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?


+ORLANDO
I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that vnfortunate he.


+ROSALIND
But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak?


+ORLANDO
Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much.


+ROSALIND
Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, deserues as wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is that the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in loue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel.


+ORLANDO
Did you euer cure any so?


+ROSALIND
Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to imagine me his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day to woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful of teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are for the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like him, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear him: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue my Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor of madnes, wc was to forsweare the ful stream of ye world, and to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd him, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Liuer as cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not be one spot of Loue in't.


+ORLANDO
I would not be cured, youth.


+ROSALIND
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me.


+ORLANDO
Now by the faith of my loue, I will ; Tel me where it is.


+ROSALIND
Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by the way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue: Wil you go?


+ORLANDO
With all my heart, good youth.


+ROSALIND
Nay, you must call mee Rosalind: Come sister, will you go?

+CLOWNE
Come apace good Audrey, I wil fetch vp
your / Goates, Audrey : and how Audrey am I the man
yet? / Doth my simple feature content you?


+AUDREY
Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features?


+CLOWNE
I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most capricious Poet honest Ouid was among the Gothes.


+IAQUES
O knowledge ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in a thatch'd house.


+CLOWNE
When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vnderstanding: it strikes a man more dead then a great reckoning in a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde made thee poeticall.


+AUDREY
I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in deed and word: is it a true thing?


+CLOWNE
No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most faining, and Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they sweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne.


+AUDREY
Do you wish then that the Gods had made me Poeticall?


+CLOWNE
I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art honest: Now if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope thou didst feigne.


+AUDREY
Would you not haue me honest?


+CLOWNE
No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for honestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to Sugar.


+IAQUES
A materiall foole.


+AUDREY
Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the Gods make me honest.


+CLOWNE
Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule slut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish.


+AUDREY
I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I am foule.


+CLOWNE
Well, praised be the Gods, for thy foulnesse; sluttishnesse may come heereafter. But be it, as it may bee, I wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir Oliuer Mar-text, the Vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meete me in this place of the Forrest, and to couple vs.


+IAQUES
I would faine see this meeting.


+AUDREY
Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy.


+CLOWNE
Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple but the wood, no assembly but horne-beasts. But what though? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are necessarie. It is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods; right: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none of his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone: No, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Rascall: Is the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd Towne is more worthier then a village, so is the forehead of a married man, more honourable then the bare brow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is better then no skill, by so much is a horne more precious then to want.

Is there none heere to giue the woman?


+CLOWNE
I wil not take her on guift of any man.

Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not lawfull.

Proceed, proceede: Ile giue her.

Wil you be married, Motley?


+CLOWNE
As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb, and the Falcon her bels, so man hath his desires, and as Pigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling.


+IAQUES
And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be married vnder a bush like a begger? Get you to church, and haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is, this fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne Wainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell, and like greene timber, warpe, warpe.


+CLOWNE
I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee married of him then of another, for he is not like to marrie me wel: and not being wel married, it wil be a good excuse for me heereafter, to leaue my wife.


+IAQUES
Goe thou with mee, / And let me counsel thee.

Come sweete Audrey, / We must be married,
or we must liue in baudrey: / Farewel good Mr

As good cause as one would desire, / Therefore weepe.

His very haire / Is of the dissembling colour.

Something browner then Iudasses: / Marrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children.

I'faith his haire is of a good colour.


+CELIA
An excellent colour: / Your Chessenut was euer the onely colour:


+ROSALIND
And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie, / As the touch of holy bread.


+CELIA
Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of Diana: a Nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie, the very yce of chastity is in them.

But why did hee sweare hee would come this morning, and comes not?


+CELIA
Nay certainly there is no truth in him.


+ROSALIND
Doe you thinke so?


+CELIA
Yes, I thinke he is not a picke purse, nor a horsestealer, but for his verity in loue, I doe thinke him as concaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme-eaten nut.


+ROSALIND
Not true in loue?


+CELIA
Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he is not in.


+ROSALIND
You haue heard him sweare downright he was.


+CELIA
Was, is not is: besides, the oath of Louer is no stronger then the word of a Tapster, they are both the confirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the forrest on the Duke your father.


+ROSALIND
I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him: he askt me of what parentage I was; I told him of as good as he, so he laugh'd and let mee goe. But what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando?


+CELIA
O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses, speakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes them brauely, quite trauers athwart the heart of his louer, as a puisny Tilter, y^t spurs his horse but on one side, breakes his staffe like a noble goose; but all's braue that youth mounts, and folly guides: who comes heere?

Mistresse and Master, you haue oft enquired
After the Shepheard that complain'd of loue,
Who you saw sitting by me on the Turph,
Praising the proud disdainfull Shepherdesse
That was his Mistresse.

Well: and what of him?

If you will see a pageant truely plaid
Betweene the pale complexion of true Loue,
And the red glowe of scorne and prowd disdaine,
Goe hence a little, and I shall conduct you
If you will marke it.

Sweet Phebe doe not scorne me, do not Phebe
Say that you loue me not, but say not so
In bitternesse; the common executioner
Whose heart th'accustom'd sight of death makes hard
Falls not the axe vpon the humbled neck,
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
Then he that dies and liues by bloody drops?


SD: Enter +ROSALIND, +CELIA, and +CORIN.


+PHEBE
I would not be thy executioner,
I flye thee, for I would not iniure thee:
Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye,
'Tis pretty sure, and very probable,
That eyes that are the frailst, and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomyes,
Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers.
Now I doe frowne on thee with all my heart,
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe,
Or if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame,
Lye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers:
Now shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee,
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines
Some scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush
The Cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes
Which I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
That can doe hurt.


+SILUIUS
O deere Phebe,
If euer (as that euer may be neere)
You meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie,
Then shall you know the wouuds inuisible        
That Loues keene arrows make.


+PHEBE
But till that time
Come not thou neere me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not,
As till that time I shall not pitty thee.


+ROSALIND
And why I pray you? who might be your mother
That you insult, exult, and all at once
Ouer the wretched? what though you hau no beauty
As by my faith, I see no more in you
Then without Candle may goe darke to bed:
Must you be therefore prowd and pittilesse?
Why what meanes this? why do you looke on me?
I see no more in you then in the ordinary
Of Natures sale-worke? 'ods my little life,
I thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too:
No faith proud Mistresse, hope not after it,
'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke silke haire,
Your bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame
That can entame my spirits to your worship:
You foolish Shepheard, wherefore do you follow her
Like foggy South, puffing with winde and raine,
You are a thousand times a properer man
Then she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as you
That makes the world full of ill-fauourd children:
'Tis not her glasse, but you that flatters her,
And out of you she sees her selfe more proper
Then any of her lineaments can show her:
But Mistris, know your selfe, downe on your knees
And thanke heauen, fasting, for a good mans loue;
For I must tell you friendly in your eare,
Sell when you can, you are not for all markets:
Cry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer,
Foule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee Shepheard, fare you well.


+PHEBE
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a yere together,
I had rather here you chide, then this man wooe.


+ROSALIND
Hees falne in loue with your foulnesse, & shee'll / Fall in loue with my anger. If it        
be so, as fast / As she answeres thee with frowning lookes,         ile sauce / Her with bitter words: why looke you so vpon me?


+PHEBE
For no ill will I beare you.


+ROSALIND
I pray you do not fall in loue with mee,
For I am falser then vowes made in wine:
Besides, I like you not: if you will know my house,
'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard by:
Will you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard:
Come Sister: Shepheardesse, looke on him better
And be not proud, though all the world could see,
None could be so abus'd in sight as hee.
Come, to our flocke,

Sweet Phebe pitty me.

Why I am sorry for thee gentle Siluius.


+SILUIUS
Where euer sorrow is, reliefe would be:
If you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue,
By giuing loue your sorrow, and my griefe
Were both extermin'd.


+PHEBE
Thou hast my loue, is not that neighbourly?


+SILUIUS
I would haue you.


+PHEBE
Why that were couetousnesse:
Siluius; the time was, that I hated thee;
And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue,
But since that thou canst talke of loue so well,
Thy company, which erst was irkesome to me
I will endure; and Ile employ thee too:
But doe not looke for further recompence
Then thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd.


+SILUIUS
So holy, and so perfect is my loue,
And I in such a pouerty of grace,
That I shall thinke it a most plenteous crop
To gleane the broken eares after the man
That the maine haruest reapes: loose now and then
A scattred smile, and that Ile liue vpon.


+PHEBE
Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yerewhile?


+SILUIUS
Not very well, but I haue met him oft,
And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds
That the old Carlot once was Master of.


+PHEBE
Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,
'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well,
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speakes them pleases those that heare:
It is a pretty youth, not very prettie,
But sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him;
Hee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion: and faster then his tongue
Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp:
He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall:
His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty rednesse in his lip,
A little riper, and more lustie red
Then that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference
Betwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske.
There be some women Siluius, had they markt him
In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere
To fall in loue with him: but for my part
I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet
Haue more cause to hate him then to loue him,
For what had he to doe to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,
And now I am remembred, scorn'd at me:
I maruell why I answer'd not againe,
But that's all one: omittance is no quittance:
Ile write to him a very tanting Letter,
And thou shalt beare it, wilt thou Siluius?


+SILUIUS
Phebe, with all my heart.


+PHEBE
Ile write it strait:
The matter's in my head, and in my heart,
I will be bitter with him, and passing short;
Goe with me Siluius.

They say you are a melancholly fellow.


+IAQUES
I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing.


+ROSALIND
Those that are in extremity of either, are abhominable fellowes, and betray themselues to euery moderne censure, worse then drunkards.


+IAQUES
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.


+ROSALIND
Why then 'tis good to be a poste.


+IAQUES
I haue neither the Schollers melancholy, which is emulation: nor the Musitians, which is fantasticall; nor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers, which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick: nor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine owne, compounded of many simples, extracted from many obiects, and indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in which by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadnesse.


+ROSALIND
A Traueller: by my faith you haue great reason to be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands, to see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue nothing, is to haue rich eyes and poore hands.


+IAQUES
Yes, I haue gain'd my experience.

Good day, and happinesse, deere Rosalind.


+IAQUES
Nay then God buy you, and you talke in blanke verse.


+ROSALIND
Farewell Mounsieur Trauellor: looke you lispe, and weare strange suites; disable all the benefits of your owne Countrie: be out of loue with your natiuitie, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce thinke you haue swam in a Gundello. Why how now Orlando, where haue you bin all this while? you a louer? and you serue me such another tricke, neuer come in my sight more.


+ORLANDO
My faire Rosalind, I come within an houre of my promise.


+ROSALIND
Breake an houres promise in loue? hee that will diuide a minute into a thousand parts, and breake but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of loue, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapt him oth' shoulder, but Ile warrant him heart hole.


+ORLANDO
Pardon me deere Rosalind.


+ROSALIND
Nay, and you be so tardie, come no more in my sight, I had as liefe be woo'd of a Snaile.


+ORLANDO
Of a Snaile?


+ROSALIND
I, of a Snaile: for though he comes slowly, hee carries his house on his head; a better ioyncture I thinke then you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie with him.


+ORLANDO
What's that?


+ROSALIND
Why hornes: wc such as youare faine to be beholding to your wiues for: but he comes armed in his fortune, and preuents the slander of his wife.


+ORLANDO
Vertue is no horne-maker: and my Rosalind is vertuous.


+ROSALIND
And I am your Rosalind.


+CELIA
It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a Rosalind of a better leere then you.


+ROSALIND
Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a holy-day humor, and like enough to consent: What would you say to me now, and I were your verie, verie Rosalind?


+ORLANDO
I would kisse before I spoke.


+ROSALIND
Nay,you were better speake first, and when you were grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take occasion to kisse: verie good Orators when they are out, they will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs) matter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse.


+ORLANDO
How if the kisse be denide?


+ROSALIND
Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins new matter.


+ORLANDO
Who could be out, being before his beloued Mistris?


+ROSALIND
Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris, or I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit.


+ORLANDO
What, of my suite?


+ROSALIND
Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your suite: Am not I your Rosalind?


+ORLANDO
I take some ioy to say you are, because I would be talking of her.


+ROSALIND
Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you.


+ORLANDO
Then in mine owne person, I die.


+ROSALIND
No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is almost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there was not anie man died in his owne person (videlicet) in a loue cause: Troilous had his braines dash'd out with a Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before, and he is one of the patternes of loue. Leander, he would haue liu'd manie a faire yeere though Hero had turn'd Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer-night, for (good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the crampe, was droun'd, and the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was Hero of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not for loue.


+ORLANDO
I would not haue my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frowne might kill me.


+ROSALIND
By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more comming-on disposition: and aske me what you will, I will grant it.


+ORLANDO
Then loue me Rosalind.


+ROSALIND
Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all.


+ORLANDO
And wilt thou haue me?


+ROSALIND
I, and twentie such.


+ORLANDO
What saiest thou?


+ROSALIND
Are you not good?


+ORLANDO
I hope so.


+ROSALIND
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and marrie vs: giue me your hand Orlando: What doe you say sister?


+ORLANDO
Pray thee marrie vs.


+CELIA
I cannot say the words.

You must begin, will you Orlando.

Goe too: wil you Orlando, haue to wife this Rosalind?


+ORLANDO
I will.


+ROSALIND
I, but when?


+ORLANDO
Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs.


+ROSALIND
Then you must say, I take thee Rosalind for wife.


+ORLANDO
I take thee Rosalind for wife.


+ROSALIND
I might aske you for your Commission, / But I doe take thee Orlando for my husband : there's a girle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans thought runs before her actions.


+ORLANDO
So do all thoughts, they are wing'd.


+ROSALIND
Now tell me how long you would haue her, after you haue possest her?


+ORLANDO
For euer, and a day.


+ROSALIND
Say a day, without the euer: no, no Orlando, men are Aprill when they woe, December when they wed: Maides are May when they are maides, but the sky changes when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of thee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more clamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new-fangled then an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a monkey: I will weepe for nothing, like Diana in the Fountaine, & I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry: I will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd to sleepe.


+ORLANDO
But will my Rosalind doe so?


+ROSALIND
By my life, she will doe as I doe.


+ORLANDO
O but she is wise.


+ROSALIND
Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this: the wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a womans wit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the smoake out at the chimney.


+ORLANDO
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, wit whether wil't?


+ROSALIND
Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you met your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed.


+ORLANDO
And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that?


+ROSALIND
Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you shall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take her without her tongue: ô that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse her childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole.


+ORLANDO
For these two houres Rosalinde, I wil leaue thee.


+ROSALIND
Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres.


+ORLANDO
I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two a clock I will be with thee againe.


+ROSALIND
I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what you would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I thought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne me: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two o'clocke is your howre.


+ORLANDO
I, sweet Rosalind.


+ROSALIND
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dangerous, if you breake one iot of your promise, or come one minute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most patheticall breake-promise, and the most hollow louer, and the most vnworthy of her you call Rosalinde, that may bee chosen out of the grosse band of the vnfaithfull: therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.


+ORLANDO
With no lesse religion, then if thou wert indeed my Rosalind: so adieu.


+ROSALIND
Well, Time is the olde Iustice that examines all such offenders, and let time try: adieu.

O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but it cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne bottome, like the Bay of Portugall.


+CELIA
Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure affection in, in runs out.

No, that same wicked Bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of madnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery ones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge, how deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando: Ile goe finde a shadow, and sigh till he come.

My errand is to you, faire youth,
My gentle Phebe, did bid me giue you this:
I know not the contents, but as I guesse
By the sterne brow, and waspish action
Which she did vse, as she was writing of it,
It beares an angry tenure; pardon me,
I am but as a guiltlesse messenger.


+ROSALIND
Patience her selfe would startle at this letter,
And play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all:
Shee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners,
She calls me proud, and that she could not loue me
Were man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my will,
Her loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt,
Why writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well,
This is a Letter of your owne deuice.


+SILUIUS
No, I protest, I know not the contents,
Phebe did write it.


+ROSALIND
Come, come, you are a foole,
And turn'd into the extremity of loue.
I saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand,
A freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke
That her old gloues were on, but twas her hands:
She has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter:
I say she neuer did inuent this letter,
This is a mans inuention, and his hand.


+SILUIUS
Sure it is hers.


+ROSALIND
Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile,
A stile for challengers: why, she defies me,
Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine
Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention,
Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
Then in their countenance: will you heare the letter?


+SILUIUS
So please you, for I neuer heard it yet:
Yet heard too much of Phebes crueltie.

She Phebes me: marke how the tyrant writes.
[Read.] *Art thou god, to Shepherd turn'd?
That a maidens heart hath burn'd.*
Can a woman raile thus?

Call you this railing?


+ROSALIND
[Read.] *Why, thy godhead laid a part,
War'st thou with a womans heart?*
Did you euer heare such railing?
*Whiles the eye of man did wooe me,
That could do no vengeance to me.*
Meaning me a beast.
*If the scorne of your bright eine
Haue power to raise such loue in mine,
Alacke, in me, what strange effect
Would they worke in milde aspect?
Whiles you chid me, I did loue,
How then might your praiers moue?
He that brings this loue to thee,
Little knowes this Loue in me:
And by him seale vp thy minde,
Whether that thy youth and kinde
Will the faithfull offer take
Of me, and all that I can make,
Or else by him my loue denie,
And then Ile studie how to die.*

Alas poore Shepheard.

Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty: wilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an instrument, and play false straines vpon thee? not to be endur'd. Well, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath made thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she loue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will neuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a true louer hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

The ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame
Left on your right hand, brings you to the place:
But at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe,
There's none within.

If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
Then should I know you by description,
Such garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire,
Of femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
And browner then her brother: are not you
The owner of the house I did enquire for?

It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

And to that youth hee calls his Rosalind,
He sends this bloudy napkin; are you he?

What man I am, and how, and why, and where
This handkercher was stain'd.

+OLIUER
When last the yong Orlando parted from you,
He left a promise to returne againe
Within an houre, and pacing through the Forrest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie,
Loe what befell: he threw his eye aside,
And marke what obiect did present it selfe
Vnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age
And high top, bald with drie antiquitie:
A wretched ragged man, ore-growne with haire
Lay sleeping on his back; about his necke
A greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe,
Who with her head, nimble in threats approach'd
The opening of his mouth: but sodainly
Seeing Orlando, it vnlink'd it selfe,
And with indented glides, did slip away
Into a bush, vnder which bushes shade
A Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie,
Lay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch
When that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis
The royall disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead:
This seene, Orlando did approach the man,
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.


+CELIA
O I haue heard him speake of that same brother,
And he did render him the most vnnaturall
That liu'd amongst men.


+OLIUER
And well he might so doe,
For well I know he was vnnaturall.


+ROSALIND
But to Orlando: did he leaue him there
Food to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse?


+OLIUER
Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so:
But kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge,
And Nature stronger then his iust occasion,
Made him giue battell to the Lyonnesse:
Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked.


+CELIA
Are you his brother?


+ROSALIND
Was't you he rescu'd?


+CELIA
Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him?


+OLIUER
'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conuersion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.


+ROSALIND
But for the bloody napkin?


+OLIUER
By and by:
When from the first to last betwixt vs two,
Teares our recountments had most kindely bath'd,
As how I came into that Desert place.
I briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke,
Who gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment,
Committing me vnto my brothers loue,
Who led me instantly vnto his Caue,
There stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme
The Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
And cride in fainting vpon Rosalinde.
Briefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound,
And after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to giue this napkin
Died in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth,
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.


+CELIA
Why how now Ganimed, sweet Ganimed.


+OLIUER
Many will swoon when they do look on bloud.

Looke, he recouers.

Wee'll lead you thither:
I pray you will you take him by the arme.


+OLIUER
Be of good cheere youth: you a man? You lacke a mans heart.


+ROSALIND
I doe so, I confesse it: Ah, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfeited, I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited: heigh-ho.


+OLIUER
This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony in your complexion, that it was a passion of earnest.


+ROSALIND
Counterfeit, I assure you.


+OLIUER
Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.


+ROSALIND
So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a woman by right.


+CELIA
Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw homewards: good sir, goe with vs.


+OLIUER
That will I: for I must beare answere backe
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

Why, thou saist well. I do now remember a saying: The Foole doth thinke he is wise, but the wiseman knowes himselfe to be a Foole.

O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there was neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two Rammes, and Cesars Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw, and ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no sooner met, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they lou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew the reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these degrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage, which they will climbe incontinent, or else bee incontinent before marriage; they are in the verie wrath of loue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part them.

Know of me then (for now I speake to some         purpose) that I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit: I speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion of my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: neither do I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some little measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe good, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please, that I can do strange things: I haue since I was three yeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in his Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue Rosalinde so neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marrie her. I know into what straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not impossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you, to set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is, and without any danger.

Speak'st thou in sober meanings?

In the spring time, the onely pretty rang time.
When Birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
Sweet Louers loue the spring,
Betweene the acres of the Rie,
With a hey, and a ho, & a hey nonino:
These prettie Country folks would lie.
In spring time, &c.
This Carroll they began that houre,
With a hey and a ho, & a hey nonino:
How that a life was but a Flower,
In spring time, &c.
And therefore take the present time.
With a hey, & a ho, and a hey nonino,
For loue is crowned with the prime.
In spring time, &c.*

+DUKE SENIOR
Dost thou beleeue Orlando, that the boy
Can do all this that he hath promised?


+ORLANDO
I sometimes do beleeue, and somtimes do not,
As those that feare they hope, and know they feare.


SD: Enter +ROSALIND, +SILUIUS, & +PHEBE.


+ROSALIND
Patience once more, whiles our c[o]mpact is vrg'd:
You say, if I bring in your Rosalinde,
You wil bestow her on Orlando heere?


+DUKE SENIOR
That would I, had I kingdoms to giue with hir.


+ROSALIND
And you say you wil haue her, when I bring hir?


+ORLANDO
That would I, were I of all kingdomes King.


+ROSALIND
You say, you'l marrie me, if I be willing.


+PHEBE
That will I, should I die the houre after.


+ROSALIND
But if you do refuse to marrie me,
You'l giue your selfe to this most faithfull Shepheard.


+PHEBE
So is the bargaine.


+ROSALIND
You say that you'l haue Phebe if she will.


+SILUIUS
Though to haue her and death, were both one thing.


+ROSALIND
I haue promis'd to make all this matter euen :
Keepe you your word, O Duke, to giue your daughter,
You yours Orlando, to receiue his daughter :
Keepe you your word Phebe, that you'l marrie me,
Or else refusing me to wed this shepheard :
Keepe your word Siluius, that you'l marrie her
If she refuse me, and from hence I go
To make these doubts all euen.

Some liuely touches of my daughters fauour.


+ORLANDO
My Lord, the first time that I euer saw him,
Me thought he was a brother to your daughrer:
But my good Lord, this Boy is Forrest borne,
And hath bin tutor'd in the rudiments
Of many desperate studies, by his vnckle,
Whom he reports to be a great Magitian.
Obscured in the circle of this Forrest.

There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are comming to the Arke. Here comes a payre of verie strange beasts, which in all tongues, are call'd Fooles.


+CLOWNE
Salutation and greeting to you all.


+IAQUES
Good my Lord, bid him welcome: This is the Motley-minded Gentleman, that I haue so often met in the Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares.


+CLOWNE
If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my purgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady, I haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine enemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure quarrels, and like to haue fought one.


+IAQUES
And how was that tane vp?


+CLOWNE
'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon the seuenth cause.


+IAQUES
How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this fellow.


+DUKE SENIOR
I like him very well.


+CLOWNE
God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse in heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues to sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds and blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il-fauor'd thing sir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take that that no man else will rich honestie dwels like a miser sir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oyster.


+DUKE SENIOR
By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious


+CLOWNE
According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet diseases.


+IAQUES
But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde the quarrell on the seuenth cause?


+CLOWNE
Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your bodie more seeming Audry) as thus sir: I did dislike the cut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it was: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him word againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word he cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest. If againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment: this is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the reproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold say, I lie: this is call'd the counter-checke quarrelsome: and so ro lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct.


+IAQUES
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?


+CLOWNE
I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial: nor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee measur'd swords, and parted.


+IAQUES
Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of the lye.


+CLOWNE
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you haue bookes for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort courteous: the second, the Quip-modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth, the Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quarrelsome: the sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the seauenth, the Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the Lye direct : and you may auoide that too, with an If. I knew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell, but when the parties were met themselues, one of them thought but of an If; as if you saide so, then I saide so: and they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your If, is the onely peace-maker: much vertue in if.


+IAQUES
Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good at any thing, and yet a foole.


+DUKE SENIOR
He vses his folly like a stalking-horse, and vnder the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

When earthly things made eauen

Good Duke receiue thy daughter,
Hymen from Heauen brought her,
Yea brought her hether,
That thou mightst ioyne his hand with his,
Whose heart within his bosome is.*

Of these most strange euents:

To ioyne in Hymens bands,
If truth holds true contents.

You and you, are hart in hart:
You, to his loue must accord,
Or haue a Woman to your Lord.

Whiles a Wedlocke Hymne we sing,
Feede your selues with questioning:
That reason, wonder may diminish
How thus we met, and these things finish.

Let me haue audience for a word or two:
I am the second sonne of old Sir Rowland,
That bring these tidings to this faire assembly.
Duke Frederick hearing how that euerie day
Men of great worth resorted to this forrest,
Addrest a mightie power, which were on foote
In his owne conduct, purposely to take
His brother heere, and put him to the sword:
And to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came;
Where, meeting with an old Religious man,
After some question with him, was conuerted
Both from his enterprize, and from the world:
His crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother,
And all their Lands restor'd to him againe
That were with him exil'd. This to be true,
I do engage my life.


+DUKE SENIOR
Welcome yong man:
Thou offer'st fairely to thy brothers wedding:
To one his lands with-held, and to the other
A land it selfe at large, a potent Dukedome.
First, in this Forrest, let vs do those ends
That heere wete well begun, and wel begot:
And after, euery of this happie number
That haue endur'd shrew'd daies, and nights with vs,
Shal share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meane time, forget this new-falne dignitie,
And fall into our Rusticke Reuelrie:
Play Musicke, and you Brides and Bride-groomes all,
With measure heap'd in ioy, to'th Measures fall.


+IAQUES
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,
The Duke hath put on a Religious life,
And throwne into neglect the pompous Court.


+SECOND BROTHER
He hath.


+IAQUES
To him will I: out of these conuertites,
There is much matter to be heard, and learn'd:
you to your former Honor, I bequeath
your patience, and your vertue, well deserues it.
you to a loue, that your true faith doth merit:
you to your land, and loue, and great allies:
you to a long, and well-deserued bed:
And you to wrangling, for thy louing voyage
Is but for two moneths victuall'd: So to your pleasures,
I am for other, then for dancing meazures.

Stay, Iaques, stay.

It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epilogue: but it is no more vnhandsome, then to see the Lord the Prologue. If it be true, that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue. Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good playes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues: What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure you, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men) for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you, and the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman, I would kisse as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defi'de not : And I am sure, as many as haue good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell.
