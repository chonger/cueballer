Enter King Richard in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe,	
and the Earl of Surrey, and soldiers	
KING RICHARD	
Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.	
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?	
SURREY	
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.	
KING RICHARD	
My Lord of Norfolk –	
NORFOLK	
Here, most gracious liege.	
KING RICHARD	
Norfolk, we must have knocks. Ha! Must we not?	
NORFOLK	
We must both give and take, my loving lord.	
KING RICHARD	
Up with my tent! Here will I lie tonight.	
Soldiers begin to set up the King's tent	
But where tomorrow? Well, all's one for that.	
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?	
NORFOLK	
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.	
KING RICHARD	
Why, our battalia trebles that account;	
Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,	
Which they upon the adverse faction want.	
Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,	
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.	
Call for some men of sound direction.	
Let's lack no discipline, make no delay,	
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.	
Exeunt	
Enter Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford,	
Dorset, Herbert, and Blunt. Some of the soldiers pitch	
Richmond's tent	
RICHMOND	
The weary sun hath made a golden set	
And by the bright track of his fiery car	
Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.	
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.	
Give me some ink and paper in my tent:	
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,	
Limit each leader to his several charge,	
And part in just proportion our small power.	
My Lord of Oxford – you, Sir William Brandon –	
And you, Sir Walter Herbert – stay with me.	
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;	
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,	
And by the second hour in the morning	
Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.	
Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me –	
Where is Lord Stanley quartered, do you know?	
BLUNT	
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,	
Which well I am assured I have not done,	
His regiment lies half a mile at least	
South from the mighty power of the King.	
RICHMOND	
If without peril it be possible,	
Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him	
And give him from me this most needful note.	
BLUNT	
Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;	
And so God give you quiet rest tonight!	
RICHMOND	
Good night, good Captain Blunt.	
Exit Blunt	
Come, gentlemen,	
Let us consult upon tomorrow's business.	
Into my tent; the dew is raw and cold.	
They withdraw into the tent	
Enter, to his tent, King Richard, Ratcliffe, Norfolk,	
and Catesby	
KING RICHARD	
What is't a clock?	
CATESBY	
It's supper-time, my lord;	
It's nine a clock.	
KING RICHARD	
I will not sup tonight.	
Give me some ink and paper.	
What, is my beaver easier than it was?	
And all my armour laid into my tent?	
CATESBY	
It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.	
KING RICHARD	
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;	
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.	
NORFOLK	
I go, my lord.	
KING RICHARD	
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.	
NORFOLK	
I warrant you, my lord.	
Exit	
KING RICHARD	
Catesby!	
CATESBY	
My lord?	
KING RICHARD	
Send out a pursuivant-at-arms	
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power	
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall	
Into the blind cave of eternal night.	
Exit Catesby	
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.	
Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.	
Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy.	
Ratcliffe!	
RATCLIFFE	
My lord?	
KING RICHARD	
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?	
RATCLIFFE	
Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,	
Much about cockshut-time, from troop to troop	
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.	
KING RICHARD	
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.	
I have not that alacrity of spirit	
Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.	
A bowl of wine is brought	
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?	
RATCLIFFE	
It is, my lord.	
KING RICHARD	
Bid my guard watch. Leave me. Ratcliffe,	
About the mid of night come to my tent	
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.	
Exit Ratcliffe with others	
King Richard withdraws into his tent, and sleeps	
Enter Earl of Derby to Richmond in his tent, lords	
and others attending	
DERBY	
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!	
RICHMOND	
All comfort that the dark night can afford	
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!	
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?	
DERBY	
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,	
Who prays continually for Richmond's good.	
So much for that. The silent hours steal on	
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.	
In brief, for so the season bids us be,	
Prepare thy battle early in the morning	
And put thy fortune to th' arbitrement	
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.	
I, as I may – that which I would I cannot –	
With best advantage will deceive the time	
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.	
But on thy side I may not be too forward,	
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,	
Be executed in his father's sight.	
Farewell. The leisure and the fearful time	
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love	
And ample interchange of sweet discourse	
Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon.	
God give us leisure for these rites of love!	
Once more adieu. Be valiant, and speed well!	
RICHMOND	
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.	
I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,	
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow,	
When I should mount with wings of victory.	
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.	
Exeunt	
Richmond remains	
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,	
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;	
Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,	
That they may crush down with a heavy fall	
Th' usurping helmets of our adversaries;	
Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,	
That we may praise Thee in the victory.	
To Thee I do commend my watchful soul	
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.	
Sleeping and waking, O defend me still!	
Sleeps	
Enter the Ghost of Prince Edward, son to Henry the	
Sixth	
GHOST	
(To Richard)	
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!	
Think how thou stab'st me in my prime of youth	
At Tewkesbury; despair therefore, and die!	
(To Richmond)	
Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged souls	
Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf	
King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.	
Exit	
Enter the Ghost of Henry the Sixth	
GHOST	
(to Richard)	
When I was mortal, my anointed body	
By thee was punched full of deadly holes.	
Think on the Tower, and me; despair, and die!	
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die!	
(To Richmond) Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!	
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,	
Doth comfort thee in thy sleep; live, and flourish!	
Exit	
Enter the Ghost of Clarence	
GHOST	
(to Richard)	
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow –	
I that was washed to death with fulsome wine,	
Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!	
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,	
And fall thy edgeless sword; despair, and die!	
(To Richmond) Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,	
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee;	
Good angels guard thy battle! Live, and flourish!	
Exit	
Enter the Ghosts of Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan	
RIVERS	
(to Richard)	
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow,	
Rivers, that died at Pomfret; despair, and die!	
GREY	
Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!	
VAUGHAN	
Think upon Vaughan and with guilty fear	
Let fall thy lance; despair, and die!	
ALL	
(to Richmond)	
Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom	
Will conquer him! Awake, and win the day!	
Exeunt Ghosts	
Enter the Ghost of Lord Hastings	
GHOST	
(to Richard)	
Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake	
And in a bloody battle end thy days!	
Think on Lord Hastings; despair, and die!	
(To Richmond) Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!	
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!	
Exit	
Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes	
GHOSTS	
(to Richard)	
Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.	
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,	
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!	
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair, and die!	
(To Richmond)	
Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.	
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!	
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!	
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.	
Exit	
Enter the Ghost of Anne, his wife	
GHOST	
(to Richard)	
Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,	
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,	
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.	
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,	
And fall thy edgeless sword; despair, and die!	
(To Richmond) Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep.	
Dream of success and happy victory!	
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.	
Exit	
Enter the Ghost of Buckingham	
GHOST	
(to Richard)	
The first was I that helped thee to the crown;	
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.	
O, in the battle think on Buckingham,	
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!	
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.	
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!	
(To Richmond) I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid,	
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed;	
God and good angels fight on Richmond's side,	
And Richard falls in height of all his pride!	
Exit	
Richard starts out of his dream	
KING RICHARD	
Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!	
Have mercy, Jesu! – Soft! I did but dream.	
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!	
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.	
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.	
What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.	
Richard loves Richard: that is, I am I.	
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.	
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why –	
Lest I revenge. Myself upon myself?	
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good	
That I myself have done unto myself?	
O no! Alas, I rather hate myself	
For hateful deeds committed by myself.	
I am a villain. Yet I lie, I am not.	
Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.	
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,	
And every tongue brings in a several tale,	
And every tale condemns me for a villain.	
Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree.	
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree,	
All several sins, all used in each degree,	
Throng to the bar, crying all, ‘ Guilty! Guilty!’	
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;	
And if I die, no soul will pity me.	
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself	
Find in myself no pity to myself?	
Methought the souls of all that I had murdered	
Came to my tent, and every one did threat	
Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.	
Enter Ratcliffe	
RATCLIFFE	
My lord!	
KING RICHARD	
Zounds, who is there?	
RATCLIFFE	
Ratcliffe, my lord, 'tis I. The early village cock	
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;	
Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.	
KING RICHARD	
O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!	
What thinkest thou? Will our friends prove all true?	
RATCLIFFE	
No doubt, my lord.	
KING RICHARD	
Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear!	
RATCLIFFE	
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.	
KING RICHARD	
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight	
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard	
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers	
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.	
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me.	
Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper,	
To see if any mean to shrink from me.	
Exeunt Richard and Ratcliffe	
Enter the Lords to Richmond sitting in his tent	
LORDS	
Good morrow, Richmond!	
RICHMOND	
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,	
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.	
LORDS	
How have you slept, my lord?	
RICHMOND	
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams	
That ever entered in a drowsy head	
Have I since your departure had, my lords.	
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered	
Came to my tent and cried on victory.	
I promise you my heart is very jocund	
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.	
How far into the morning is it, lords?	
LORDS	
Upon the stroke of four.	
RICHMOND	
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.	
His oration to his soldiers	
More than I have said, loving countrymen,	
The leisure and enforcement of the time	
Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this:	
God and our good cause fight upon our side;	
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,	
Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.	
Richard except, those whom we fight against	
Had rather have us win than him they follow.	
For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,	
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;	
One raised in blood and one in blood established;	
One that made means to come by what he hath,	
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;	
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil	
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;	
One that hath ever been God's enemy.	
Then if you fight against God's enemy,	
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;	
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,	
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;	
If you do fight against your country's foes,	
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;	
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,	
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;	
If you do free your children from the sword,	
Your children's children quits it in your age.	
Then in the name of God and all these rights,	
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.	
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt	
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;	
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt	
The least of you shall share his part thereof.	
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully:	
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!	
Exeunt	
Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe, and soldiers	
KING RICHARD	
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?	
RATCLIFFE	
That he was never trained up in arms.	
KING RICHARD	
He said the truth. And what said Surrey then?	
RATCLIFFE	
He smiled and said, ‘ The better for our purpose.’	
KING RICHARD	
He was in the right, and so indeed it is.	
Clock strikes	
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.	
Who saw the sun today?	
RATCLIFFE	
Not I, my lord.	
KING RICHARD	
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book	
He should have braved the east an hour ago.	
A black day will it be to somebody.	
Ratcliffe!	
RATCLIFFE	
My lord?	
KING RICHARD	
The sun will not be seen today;	
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.	
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.	
Not shine today? Why, what is that to me	
More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven	
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.	
Enter Norfolk	
NORFOLK	
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.	
KING RICHARD	
Come, bustle, bustle! Caparison my horse!	
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.	
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,	
And thus my battle shall be ordered:	
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,	
Consisting equally of horse and foot;	
Our archers shall be placed in the midst;	
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,	
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.	
They thus directed, we will follow	
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side	
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.	
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?	
NORFOLK	
A good direction, warlike sovereign.	
This found I on my tent this morning.	
He showeth him a paper	
KING RICHARD	
(reads)	
‘ Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,	
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.’	
A thing devised by the enemy.	
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge.	
(Aside) Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;	
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,	
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.	
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law!	
(To them) March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell,	
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.	
His oration to his army	
What shall I say more than I have inferred?	
Remember whom you are to cope withal –	
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,	
A scum of Britains and base lackey peasants,	
Whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth	
To desperate adventures and assured destruction.	
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;	
You having lands, and blessed with beauteous wives,	
They would distrain the one, distain the other.	
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,	
Long kept in Britain at our mother's cost?	
A milksop, one that never in his life	
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?	
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again,	
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,	
These famished beggars, weary of their lives,	
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,	
For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves.	
If we be conquered, let men conquer us,	
And not these bastard Britains, whom our fathers	
Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped,	
And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.	
Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives?	
Ravish our daughters? (Drum afar off) Hark! I hear their drum.	
Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!	
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!	
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood!	
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!	
Enter a Messenger	
What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?	
MESSENGER	
My lord, he doth deny to come.	
KING RICHARD	
Off with his son George's head!	
NORFOLK	
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.	
After the battle let George Stanley die.	
KING RICHARD	
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom!	
Advance our standards, set upon our foes.	
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,	
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!	
Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.	
Exeunt
