Act 1, scene 1
Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund	
KENT	
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of	
Albany than Cornwall.	
GLOUCESTER	
It did always seem so to us. But now in the	
division of the kingdom it appears not which of the	
Dukes he values most, for qualities are so weighed that	
curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.	
KENT	
Is not this your son, my lord?	
GLOUCESTER	
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.	
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I	
am brazed to it.	
KENT	
I cannot conceive you.	
GLOUCESTER	
Sir, this young fellow's mother could;	
whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed,	
sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her	
bed. Do you smell a fault?	
KENT	
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being	
so proper.	
GLOUCESTER	
But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some	
year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account.	
Though this knave came something saucily to the world,	
before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there	
was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be	
acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman,	
Edmund?	
EDMUND	
No, my lord.	
GLOUCESTER	
My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter	
as my honourable friend.	
EDMUND	
My services to your lordship.	
KENT	
I must love you and sue to know you better.	
EDMUND	
Sir, I shall study deserving.	
GLOUCESTER	
He hath been out nine years, and away he	
shall again. The King is coming.	
Sound a sennet. Enter one bearing a coronet	
Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Gonerill, Regan,	
Cordelia, and attendants	
LEAR	
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,	
Gloucester	
GLOUCESTER	
I shall, my liege.	
Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund	
LEAR	
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.	
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided	
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent	
To shake all cares and business from our age,	
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we	
Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall –	
And you, our no less loving son of Albany –	
We have this hour a constant will to publish	
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife	
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,	
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,	
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,	
And here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters,	
Since now we will divest us both of rule,	
Interest of territory, cares of state,	
Which of you shall we say doth love us most,	
That we our largest bounty may extend	
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Gonerill,	
Our eldest born, speak first.	
GONERILL	
Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter,	
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,	
Beyond what can be valued rich or rare,	
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,	
As much as child e'er loved or father found;	
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;	
Beyond all manner of ‘ so much ’ I love you.	
CORDELIA	
(aside)	
What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.	
LEAR	
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,	
With shadowy forests and with champains riched,	
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,	
We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issues	
Be this perpetual. – What says our second daughter,	
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?	
REGAN	
I am made of the self metal as my sister	
And price me at her worth. In my true heart	
I find she names my very deed of love;	
Only she comes too short, that I profess	
Myself an enemy to all other joys	
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,	
And find I am alone felicitate	
In your dear highness' love.	
CORDELIA	
(aside)	
Then poor Cordelia!	
And yet not so, since I am sure my love's	
More ponderous than my tongue.	
LEAR	
To thee and thine hereditary ever	
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,	
No less in space, validity, and pleasure	
Than that conferred on Gonerill. – Now, our joy,	
Although our last and least, to whose young love	
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy	
Strive to be interessed; what can you say to draw	
A third more opulent than your sisters'? Speak!	
CORDELIA	
Nothing, my lord.	
LEAR	
Nothing?	
CORDELIA	
Nothing.	
LEAR	
Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.	
CORDELIA	
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave	
My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty	
According to my bond, no more nor less.	
LEAR	
How, how, Cordelia! Mend your speech a little	
Lest you may mar your fortunes.	
CORDELIA	
Good my lord,	
You have begot me, bred me, loved me.	
I return those duties back as are right fit,	
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.	
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say	
They love you all? Haply when I shall wed,	
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry	
Half my love with him, half my care and duty.	
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,	
To love my father all.	
LEAR	
But goes thy heart with this?	
CORDELIA	
Ay, my good lord.	
LEAR	
So young, and so untender?	
CORDELIA	
So young, my lord, and true.	
LEAR	
Let it be so! Thy truth then be thy dower!	
For by the sacred radiance of the sun,	
The mysteries of Hecat and the night,	
By all the operation of the orbs	
From whom we do exist, and cease to be,	
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,	
Propinquity and property of blood,	
And as a stranger to my heart and me	
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,	
Or he that makes his generation messes	
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom	
Be as well neighboured, pitied, and relieved	
As thou my sometime daughter.	
KENT	
Good my liege –	
LEAR	
Peace, Kent!	
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.	
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest	
On her kind nursery. (To Cordelia) Hence and avoid my sight! –	
So be my grave my peace as here I give	
Her father's heart from her. Call France! Who stirs?	
Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,	
With my two daughters' dowers digest the third.	
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.	
I do invest you jointly with my power,	
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects	
That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,	
With reservation of an hundred knights,	
By you to be sustained, shall our abode	
Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain	
The name and all th' addition to a king; the sway,	
Revenue, execution of the rest,	
Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,	
This coronet part between you.	
KENT	
Royal Lear,	
Whom I have ever honoured as my king,	
Loved as my father, as my master followed,	
As my great patron thought on in my prayers –	
LEAR	
The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.	
KENT	
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade	
The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly	
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?	
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak	
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound	
When majesty stoops to folly. Reserve thy state,	
And in thy best consideration check	
This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgement,	
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,	
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds	
Reverb no hollowness.	
LEAR	
Kent, on thy life, no more!	
KENT	
My life I never held but as a pawn	
To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,	
Thy safety being motive.	
LEAR	
Out of my sight!	
KENT	
See better, Lear, and let me still remain	
The true blank of thine eye.	
LEAR	
Now by Apollo –	
KENT	
Now by Apollo, King,	
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.	
LEAR	
O, vassal, miscreant!	
He makes to strike him	
ALBANY and CORNWALL	
Dear sir, forbear!	
KENT	
Kill thy physician and thy fee bestow	
Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,	
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat	
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.	
LEAR	
Hear me, recreant,	
On thine allegiance hear me!	
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,	
Which we durst never yet, and with strained pride	
To come betwixt our sentence and our power,	
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,	
Our potency made good, take thy reward.	
Five days we do allot thee for provision	
To shield thee from disasters of the world,	
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back	
Upon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following	
Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions	
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,	
This shall not be revoked!	
KENT	
Fare thee well, King, sith thus thou wilt appear,	
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here.	
(To Cordelia)	
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,	
That justly think'st and hast most rightly said.	
(To Gonerill and Regan)	
And your large speeches may your deeds approve	
That good effects may spring from words of love. –	
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;	
He'll shape his old course in a country new.	
Exit	
Flourish. Enter Gloucester with France and Burgundy,	
and attendants	
GLOUCESTER	
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.	
LEAR	
My lord of Burgundy,	
We first address toward you, who with this king	
Hath rivalled for our daughter: what in the least	
Will you require in present dower with her	
Or cease your quest of love?	
BURGUNDY	
Most royal majesty,	
I crave no more than hath your highness offered,	
Nor will you tender less.	
LEAR	
Right noble Burgundy,	
When she was dear to us we did hold her so;	
But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands;	
If aught within that little-seeming substance,	
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,	
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,	
She's there and she is yours.	
BURGUNDY	
I know no answer.	
LEAR	
Will you with those infirmities she owes,	
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,	
Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath,	
Take her or leave her?	
BURGUNDY	
Pardon me, royal sir,	
Election makes not up in such conditions.	
LEAR	
Then leave her, sir, for, by the power that made me,	
I tell you all her wealth. (To France) For you, great king,	
I would not from your love make such a stray	
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you	
T' avert your liking a more worthier way	
Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed	
Almost t' acknowledge hers.	
FRANCE	
This is most strange,	
That she whom even but now was your best object,	
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,	
The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time	
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle	
So many folds of favour. Sure her offence	
Must be of such unnatural degree	
That monsters it; or your fore-vouched affection	
Fall into taint; which to believe of her	
Must be a faith that reason without miracle	
Could never plant in me.	
CORDELIA	
I yet beseech your majesty –	
If for I want that glib and oily art	
To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend	
I'll do't before I speak – that you make known	
It is no vicious blot, murder or foulness,	
No unchaste action or dishonoured step	
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour,	
But even for want of that for which I am richer:	
A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue	
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it	
Hath lost me in your liking.	
LEAR	
Better thou	
Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.	
FRANCE	
Is it but this, a tardiness in nature	
Which often leaves the history unspoke	
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,	
What say you to the lady? Love's not love	
When it is mingled with regards that stands	
Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?	
She is herself a dowry.	
BURGUNDY	
Royal Lear,	
Give but that portion which yourself proposed	
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,	
Duchess of Burgundy.	
LEAR	
Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.	
BURGUNDY	
(to Cordelia)	
I am sorry then you have so lost a father	
That you must lose a husband.	
CORDELIA	
Peace be with Burgundy!	
Since that respect and fortunes are his love,	
I shall not be his wife.	
FRANCE	
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor,	
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,	
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.	
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.	
Gods, gods! 'Tis strange that from their cold'st neglect	
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.	
Thy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,	
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.	
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy	
Can buy this unprized-precious maid of me.	
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.	
Thou losest here, a better where to find.	
LEAR	
Thou hast her, France; let her be thine, for we	
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see	
That face of hers again. Therefore begone,	
Without our grace, our love, our benison!	
Come, noble Burgundy.	
Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany,	
Gloucester, and attendants	
FRANCE	
Bid farewell to your sisters.	
CORDELIA	
The jewels of our father, with washed eyes	
Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;	
And, like a sister, am most loath to call	
Your faults as they are named. Love well our father!	
To your professed bosoms I commit him.	
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,	
I would prefer him to a better place.	
So farewell to you both.	
REGAN	
Prescribe not us our duty.	
GONERILL	
Let your study	
Be to content your lord, who hath received you	
At Fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,	
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.	
CORDELIA	
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides;	
Who covers faults, at last with shame derides.	
Well may you prosper!	
FRANCE	
Come, my fair Cordelia.	
Exeunt France and Cordelia	
GONERILL	
Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most	
nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will	
hence tonight.	
REGAN	
That's most certain, and with you; next month	
with us.	
GONERILL	
You see how full of changes his age is. The	
observation we have made of it hath not been little. He	
always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgement	
he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.	
REGAN	
'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever but	
slenderly known himself.	
GONERILL	
The best and soundest of his time hath been	
but rash. Then must we look from his age to receive not	
alone the imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but	
therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and	
choleric years bring with them.	
REGAN	
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from	
him as this of Kent's banishment.	
GONERILL	
There is further compliment of leave-taking	
between France and him. Pray you, let us hit together.	
If our father carry authority with such disposition as he	
bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.	
REGAN	
We shall further think of it.	
GONERILL	
We must do something, and i'th' heat.	
Exeunt	
Act 1, scene 2
Enter Edmund	
EDMUND	
Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law	
My services are bound. Wherefore should I	
Stand in the plague of custom and permit	
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,	
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines	
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?	
When my dimensions are as well-compact,	
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,	
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us	
With ‘ base ’? with ‘ baseness ’? ‘ bastardy ’? ‘ base, base ’?	
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take	
More composition and fierce quality	
Than doth within a dull, stale, tired bed	
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops	
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,	
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.	
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund	
As to the legitimate. Fine word ‘ legitimate ’!	
Well, my ‘ legitimate,’ if this letter speed	
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base	
Shall top the legitimate. I grow. I prosper.	
Now gods stand up for bastards!	
Enter Gloucester	
GLOUCESTER	
Kent banished thus? and France in choler parted?	
And the King gone tonight? prescribed his power?	
Confined to exhibition? All this done	
Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?	
EDMUND	
So please your lordship, none.	
GLOUCESTER	
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that	
letter?	
EDMUND	
I know no news, my lord.	
GLOUCESTER	
What paper were you reading?	
EDMUND	
Nothing, my lord.	
GLOUCESTER	
No? What needed then that terrible dispatch	
of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing	
hath not such need to hide itself. Let's see! Come! If it	
be nothing I shall not need spectacles.	
EDMUND	
I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from	
my brother that I have not all o'erread; and for so much	
as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.	
GLOUCESTER	
Give me the letter, sir.	
EDMUND	
I shall offend either to detain or give it. The	
contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.	
GLOUCESTER	
Let's see, let's see!	
EDMUND	
I hope for my brother's justification he wrote	
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.	
GLOUCESTER	
(reading)	
This policy and reverence of age	
makes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps our	
fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin	
to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged	
tyranny, who sways not as it hath power but as it is	
suffered. Come to me that of this I may speak more. If our	
father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half	
his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother,	
Edgar.	
Hum! Conspiracy! ‘ Sleep till I waked him, you should	
enjoy half his revenue.’ My son Edgar, had he a hand to	
write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came	
you to this? Who brought it?	
EDMUND	
It was not brought me, my lord. There's the	
cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my	
closet.	
GLOUCESTER	
You know the character to be your	
brother's?	
EDMUND	
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear	
it were his; but in respect of that I would fain think it	
were not.	
GLOUCESTER	
It is his!	
EDMUND	
It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is	
not in the contents.	
GLOUCESTER	
Has he never before sounded you in this	
business?	
EDMUND	
Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain	
it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers	
declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and	
the son manage his revenue.	
GLOUCESTER	
O villain, villain! His very opinion in the	
letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish	
villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll	
apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?	
EDMUND	
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please	
you to suspend your indignation against my brother till	
you can derive from him better testimony of his intent,	
you should run a certain course; where, if you violently	
proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would	
make a great gap in your own honour and shake in	
pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my	
life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to	
your honour and to no other pretence of danger.	
GLOUCESTER	
Think you so?	
EDMUND	
If your honour judge it meet I will place you	
where you shall hear us confer of this and by an	
auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that	
without any further delay than this very evening.	
GLOUCESTER	
He cannot be such a monster –	
EDMUND	
Nor is not, sure.	
GLOUCESTER	
To his father that so tenderly and entirely	
loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out.	
Wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the business after	
your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due	
resolution.	
EDMUND	
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business	
as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.	
GLOUCESTER	
These late eclipses in the sun and moon	
portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature	
can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself	
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools, friendship	
falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries,	
discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt	
son and father. This villain of mine comes under the	
prediction: there's son against father; the King falls	
from bias of nature: there's father against child. We	
have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness,	
treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly	
to our graves – find out this villain, Edmund;	
it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully – and the noble	
and true-hearted Kent banished! His offence, honesty!	
'Tis strange.	
Exit	
EDMUND	
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that	
when we are sick in fortune – often the surfeits of our	
own behaviour – we make guilty of our disasters the sun,	
the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity,	
fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and	
treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars,	
and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary	
influence; and all that we are evil in by a divine	
thrusting-on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster	
man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a	
star. My father compounded with my mother under the	
Dragon's tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so	
that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should	
have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the	
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar –	
(Enter Edgar)	
pat he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.	
My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom	
o' Bedlam. (Aloud) O these eclipses do portend these	
divisions: (he sings) Fa, sol, la, mi.	
EDGAR	
How now, brother Edmund! What serious	
contemplation are you in?	
EDMUND	
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read	
this other day, what should follow these eclipses.	
EDGAR	
Do you busy yourself with that?	
EDMUND	
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed	
unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the child and the	
parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities,	
divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king	
and nobles, needless diffidences, banishment of friends,	
dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not	
what.	
EDGAR	
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?	
EDMUND	
When saw you my father last?	
EDGAR	
The night gone by.	
EDMUND	
Spake you with him?	
EDGAR	
Ay, two hours together.	
EDMUND	
Parted you in good terms? Found you no	
displeasure in him by word nor countenance?	
EDGAR	
None at all.	
EDMUND	
Bethink yourself wherein you may have	
offended him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence	
until some little time hath qualified the heat of his	
displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with	
the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.	
EDGAR	
Some villain hath done me wrong.	
EDMUND	
That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent	
forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and,	
as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I	
will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go!	
There's my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.	
EDGAR	
Armed, brother?	
EDMUND	
Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no honest	
man if there be any good meaning toward you. I have	
told you what I have seen and heard but faintly, nothing	
like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away!	
EDGAR	
Shall I hear from you anon?	
EDMUND	
I do serve you in this business.	
Exit Edgar	
A credulous father and a brother noble,	
Whose nature is so far from doing harms	
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty	
My practices ride easy – I see the business:	
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;	
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.	
Exit	
Act 1, scene 3
Enter Gonerill and Oswald, her steward	
GONERILL	
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding	
of his Fool?	
OSWALD	
Ay, madam.	
GONERILL	
By day and night he wrongs me; every hour	
He flashes into one gross crime or other	
That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it!	
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us	
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting	
I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.	
If you come slack of former services	
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.	
OSWALD	
He's coming, madam; I hear him.	
GONERILL	
Put on what weary negligence you please,	
You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.	
If he distaste it, let him to my sister,	
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,	
Not to be overruled. Idle old man,	
That still would manage those authorities	
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,	
Old fools are babes again, and must be used	
With checks, as flatteries, when they are seen abused.	
Remember what I have said.	
OSWALD	
Well, madam.	
GONERILL	
And let his knights have colder looks among you.	
What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.	
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,	
That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister	
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.	
Exeunt	
Act 1, scene 4
Enter Kent in disguise	
KENT	
If but as well I other accents borrow	
That can my speech diffuse, my good intent	
May carry through itself to that full issue	
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,	
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,	
So may it come thy master whom thou lovest	
Shall find thee full of labours.	
Horns within. Enter Lear and Knights	
LEAR	
Let me not stay a jot for dinner! Go, get it ready!	
Exit First Knight	
How now? What art thou?	
KENT	
A man, sir.	
LEAR	
What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with	
us?	
KENT	
I do profess to be no less than I seem: to serve him	
truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest,	
to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear	
judgement, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no	
fish.	
LEAR	
What art thou?	
KENT	
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the	
King.	
LEAR	
If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king	
thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?	
KENT	
Service.	
LEAR	
Who wouldst thou serve?	
KENT	
You.	
LEAR	
Dost thou know me, fellow?	
KENT	
No, sir; but you have that in your countenance	
which I would fain call master.	
LEAR	
What's that?	
KENT	
Authority.	
LEAR	
What services canst thou do?	
KENT	
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious	
tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.	
That which ordinary men are fit for I am qualified in,	
and the best of me is diligence.	
LEAR	
How old art thou?	
KENT	
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor	
so old to dote on her for anything. I have years on my	
back forty-eight.	
LEAR	
Follow me; thou shalt serve me if I like thee no	
worse after dinner. I will not part from thee yet. Dinner,	
ho, dinner! Where's my knave, my Fool? Go you and	
call my Fool hither.	
Exit Second Knight	
Enter Oswald	
You! You, sirrah! Where's my daughter?	
OSWALD	
So please you –	
Exit	
LEAR	
What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.	
Exit Third Knight	
Where's my Fool? Ho, I think the world's asleep.	
Enter Third Knight	
How now? Where's that mongrel?	
KNIGHT	
He says, my lord, your daughter is not	
well.	
LEAR	
Why came not the slave back to me when I called	
him?	
KNIGHT	
Sir, he answered me in the roundest	
manner he would not.	
LEAR	
He would not!	
KNIGHT	
My lord, I know not what the matter is,	
but to my judgement your highness is not entertained	
with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.	
There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well	
in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also	
and your daughter.	
LEAR	
Ha! Sayest thou so?	
KNIGHT	
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I	
be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think	
your highness wronged.	
LEAR	
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception.	
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late,	
which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous	
curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of	
unkindness. I will look further into't. But where's my	
Fool? I have not seen him this two days.	
KNIGHT	
Since my young lady's going into	
France, sir, the Fool hath much pined away.	
LEAR	
No more of that! I have noted it well. Go you and	
tell my daughter I would speak with her.	
Exit Third Knight	
Go you, call hither my Fool.	
Exit another Knight	
Enter Oswald	
O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?	
OSWALD	
My lady's father.	
LEAR	
‘ My lady's father,’ my lord's knave! You whoreson	
dog! You slave! You cur!	
OSWALD	
I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your	
pardon.	
LEAR	
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?	
He strikes him	
OSWALD	
I'll not be strucken, my lord.	
KENT	
Nor tripped neither, you base football-player.	
He trips him	
LEAR	
I thank thee, fellow. Thou servest me and I'll love	
thee.	
KENT	
(to Oswald)	
Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you	
differences. Away, away! If you will measure your	
lubber's length again, tarry; but away, go to! Have you	
wisdom?	
He pushes Oswald out	
So.	
LEAR	
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's	
earnest of thy service.	
He gives him money	
Enter the Fool	
FOOL	
Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.	
LEAR	
How now, my pretty knave! How dost thou?	
FOOL	
Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.	
KENT	
Why, Fool?	
FOOL	
Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour.	
Nay, and thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt	
catch cold shortly. There, take my coxcomb! Why, this	
fellow has banished two on's daughters, and did the	
third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou	
must needs wear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle!	
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!	
LEAR	
Why, my boy?	
FOOL	
If I gave them all my living, I'd keep my coxcombs	
myself. There's mine. Beg another of thy daughters.	
LEAR	
Take heed, sirrah, the whip!	
FOOL	
Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped	
out when the Lady Brach may stand by the fire and	
stink.	
LEAR	
A pestilent gall to me!	
FOOL	
Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.	
LEAR	
Do.	
FOOL	
Mark it, nuncle:	
Have more than thou showest,	
Speak less than thou knowest,	
Lend less than thou owest,	
Ride more than thou goest,	
Learn more than thou trowest,	
Set less than thou throwest;	
Leave thy drink and thy whore	
And keep in-a-door,	
And thou shalt have more	
Than two tens to a score.	
KENT	
This is nothing, Fool.	
FOOL	
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer: you	
gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing,	
nuncle?	
LEAR	
Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.	
FOOL	
(to Kent)	
Prithee tell him; so much the rent of his	
land comes to. He will not believe a fool.	
LEAR	
A bitter fool!	
FOOL	
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a	
bitter fool and a sweet fool?	
LEAR	
No, lad; teach me.	
FOOL	
That lord that counselled thee	
To give away thy land,	
Come place him here by me;	
Do thou for him stand.	
The sweet and bitter fool	
Will presently appear:	
The one in motley here,	
The other found out – there.	
LEAR	
Dost thou call me fool, boy?	
FOOL	
All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou	
wast born with.	
KENT	
This is not altogether fool, my lord.	
FOOL	
No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I	
had a monopoly out they would have part on't; and	
ladies too – they will not let me have all the fool to myself;	
they'll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an egg and	
I'll give thee two crowns.	
LEAR	
What two crowns shall they be?	
FOOL	
Why, after I have cut the egg i'the middle and eat	
up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou	
clovest thy crown i'the middle, and gavest away both	
parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt	
Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou	
gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in	
this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.	
Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,	
For wise men are grown foppish	
And know not how their wits to wear,	
Their manners are so apish.	
LEAR	
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?	
FOOL	
I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou madest thy	
daughters thy mothers; for when thou gavest them the	
rod and puttest down thine own breeches,	
(sings)	
Then they for sudden joy did weep,	
And I for sorrow sung,	
That such a king should play bo-peep	
And go the fools among.	
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy	
fool to lie; I would fain learn to lie.	
LEAR	
And you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.	
FOOL	
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.	
They'll have me whipped for speaking true; thou'lt	
have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am	
whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind	
o' thing than a fool. And yet I would not be thee, nuncle.	
Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing	
i'the middle. Here comes one o'the parings.	
Enter Gonerill	
LEAR	
How now, daughter! What makes that frontlet on?	
You are too much of late i'the frown.	
FOOL	
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need	
to care for her frowning. Now thou art an 0 without a	
figure. I am better than thou art now; I am a fool; thou	
art nothing. (To Gonerill) Yes, forsooth, I will hold my	
tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing.	
Mum, mum!	
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,	
Weary of all, shall want some.	
He points to Lear	
That's a shelled peascod.	
GONERILL	
Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool	
But other of your insolent retinue	
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth	
In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,	
I had thought by making this well known unto you	
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful	
By what yourself too late have spoke and done	
That you protect this course and put it on	
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault	
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep;	
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal	
Might in their working do you that offence	
Which else were shame, that then necessity	
Will call discreet proceeding.	
FOOL	
For you know, nuncle,	
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long	
That it's had it head bit off by it young.	
So out went the candle and we were left darkling.	
LEAR	
Are you our daughter?	
GONERILL	
I would you would make use of your good wisdom,	
Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away	
These dispositions which of late transform you	
From what you rightly are.	
FOOL	
May not an ass know when the cart draws the	
horse?	
Whoop, Jug, I love thee!	
LEAR	
Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.	
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?	
Either his notion weakens, his discernings	
Are lethargied – Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so!	
Who is it that can tell me who I am?	
FOOL	
Lear's shadow.	
LEAR	
I would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty,	
knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I	
had daughters.	
FOOL	
Which they will make an obedient father.	
LEAR	
Your name, fair gentlewoman?	
GONERILL	
This admiration, sir, is much o'the savour	
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you	
To understand my purposes aright:	
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.	
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,	
Men so disordered, so deboshed and bold,	
That this our court, infected with their manners,	
Shows like a riotous inn; epicurism and lust	
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel	
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak	
For instant remedy. Be then desired,	
By her that else will take the thing she begs,	
A little to disquantity your train,	
And the remainders that shall still depend	
To be such men as may besort your age,	
Which know themselves and you.	
LEAR	
Darkness and devils!	
Saddle my horses! Call my train together!	
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee.	
Yet have I left a daughter.	
GONERILL	
You strike my people, and your disordered rabble	
Make servants of their betters.	
Enter Albany	
LEAR	
Woe that too late repents! – O, sir, are you come?	
Is it your will? Speak, sir! – Prepare my horses.	
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,	
More hideous when thou showest thee in a child	
Than the sea-monster!	
ALBANY	
Pray, sir, be patient.	
LEAR	
(to Gonerill)	
Detested kite, thou liest!	
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,	
That all particulars of duty know	
And in the most exact regard support	
The worships of their name. O most small fault,	
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!	
Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature	
From the fixed place, drew from heart all love,	
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!	
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in	
(he strikes his head)	
And thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people.	
Exeunt Kent and Knights	
ALBANY	
My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant	
Of what hath moved you.	
LEAR	
It may be so, my lord.	
He kneels	
Hear, Nature, hear! Dear goddess, hear!	
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend	
To make this creature fruitful.	
Into her womb convey sterility,	
Dry up in her the organs of increase,	
And from her derogate body never spring	
A babe to honour her. If she must teem,	
Create her child of spleen, that it may live	
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her.	
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,	
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,	
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits	
To laughter and contempt, that she may feel	
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is	
To have a thankless child! Away, away!	
Exit	
ALBANY	
Now gods that we adore, whereof comes this?	
GONERILL	
Never afflict yourself to know more of it;	
But let his disposition have that scope	
As dotage gives it.	
Enter Lear	
LEAR	
What, fifty of my followers at a clap!	
Within a fortnight?	
ALBANY	
What's the matter, sir?	
LEAR	
I'll tell thee – (to Gonerill) life and death! I am ashamed	
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,	
That these hot tears which break from me perforce	
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!	
Th' untented woundings of a father's curse	
Pierce every sense about thee! – Old fond eyes,	
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out	
And cast you with the waters that you loose	
To temper clay. Yea, is't come to this?	
Let it be so. I have another daughter,	
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.	
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails	
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find	
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think	
I have cast off for ever.	
Exit	
GONERILL	
Do you mark that?	
ALBANY	
I cannot be so partial, Gonerill,	
To the great love I bear you –	
GONERILL	
Pray you, content – What, Oswald, ho!	
(To the Fool)	
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!	
FOOL	
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the Fool	
with thee.	
A fox, when one has caught her,	
And such a daughter	
Should sure to the slaughter,	
If my cap would buy a halter –	
So the fool follows after.	
Exit	
GONERILL	
This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights!	
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep	
At point a hundred knights! Yes, that on every dream,	
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,	
He may enguard his dotage with their powers	
And hold our lives in mercy. – Oswald, I say!	
ALBANY	
Well, you may fear too far.	
GONERILL	
Safer than trust too far.	
Let me still take away the harms I fear,	
Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.	
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister;	
If she sustain him and his hundred knights	
When I have showed th' unfitness –	
Enter Oswald	
How now, Oswald!	
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?	
OSWALD	
Yes, madam.	
GONERILL	
Take you some company and away to horse.	
Inform her full of my particular fear,	
And thereto add such reasons of your own	
As may compact it more. Get you gone,	
And hasten your return.	
Exit Oswald	
No, no, my lord,	
This milky gentleness and course of yours,	
Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,	
You are much more a-taxed for want of wisdom	
Than praised for harmful mildness.	
ALBANY	
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell;	
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.	
GONERILL	
Nay then –	
ALBANY	
Well, well – th' event!	
Exeunt	
Act 1, scene 5
Enter Lear, Kent, Knight, and the Fool	
LEAR	
(to Kent)	
Go you before to Gloucester with these	
letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything	
you know than comes from her demand out of the letter.	
If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore	
you.	
KENT	
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your	
letter.	
Exit	
FOOL	
If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in	
danger of kibes?	
LEAR	
Ay, boy.	
FOOL	
Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall not go	
slipshod.	
LEAR	
Ha, ha, ha!	
FOOL	
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;	
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet	
I can tell what I can tell.	
LEAR	
What canst tell, boy?	
FOOL	
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab.	
Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'the middle on's	
face?	
LEAR	
No.	
FOOL	
Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that	
what a man cannot smell out he may spy into.	
LEAR	
I did her wrong.	
FOOL	
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	
LEAR	
No.	
FOOL	
Nor I neither. But I can tell why a snail has a house.	
LEAR	
Why?	
FOOL	
Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his	
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.	
LEAR	
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! – Be my	
horses ready?	
FOOL	
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the	
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.	
LEAR	
Because they are not eight?	
FOOL	
Yes, indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.	
LEAR	
To take't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!	
FOOL	
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'd have thee beaten	
for being old before thy time.	
LEAR	
How's that?	
FOOL	
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst	
been wise.	
LEAR	
O let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!	
Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!	
How now! Are the horses ready?	
KNIGHT	
Ready, my lord.	
LEAR	
Come, boy.	
Exeunt all except the Fool	
FOOL	
She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,	
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.	
Exit	
Act 2, scene 1
Enter Edmund and Curan by opposite doors	
EDMUND	
Save thee, Curan.	
CURAN	
And you, sir. I have been with your father and	
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan	
his Duchess will be here with him this night.	
EDMUND	
How comes that?	
CURAN	
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news	
abroad – I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but	
ear-kissing arguments?	
EDMUND	
Not I. Pray you what are they?	
CURAN	
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt	
the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?	
EDMUND	
Not a word.	
CURAN	
You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.	
Exit	
EDMUND	
The Duke be here tonight! The better! best!	
This weaves itself perforce into my business.	
My father hath set guard to take my brother,	
And I have one thing of a queasy question	
Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work! –	
Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!	
Enter Edgar	
My father watches. O, sir, fly this place;	
Intelligence is given where you are hid.	
You have now the good advantage of the night.	
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?	
He's coming hither now, i'the night, i'th' haste,	
And Regan with him. Have you nothing said	
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?	
Advise yourself.	
EDGAR	
I am sure on't, not a word.	
EDMUND	
I hear my father coming. Pardon me;	
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.	
Draw! Seem to defend yourself! Now quit you well.	
(Aloud)	
Yield! Come before my father! Light, ho, here!	
(Aside) Fly, brother! (Aloud) Torches, torches! (Aside) So farewell.	
Exit Edgar	
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion	
Of my more fierce endeavour. I have seen drunkards	
Do more than this in sport.	
He wounds himself in the arm	
(Aloud)	
Father, father! –	
Stop, stop! – No help?	
Enter Gloucester and servants with torches	
GLOUCESTER	
Now, Edmund, where's the villain?	
EDMUND	
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,	
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon	
To stand auspicious mistress.	
GLOUCESTER	
But where is he?	
EDMUND	
Look, sir, I bleed.	
GLOUCESTER	
Where is the villain, Edmund?	
EDMUND	
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could –	
GLOUCESTER	
Pursue him, ho! Go after.	
Exeunt some servants	
‘ By no means ’ what?	
EDMUND	
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;	
But that I told him the revenging gods	
'Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,	
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond	
The child was bound to the father – sir, in fine,	
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood	
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion	
With his prepared sword he charges home	
My unprovided body, latched mine arm:	
But when he saw my best alarumed spirits	
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to th' encounter,	
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,	
Full suddenly he fled.	
GLOUCESTER	
Let him fly far,	
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;	
And found – dispatch. The noble Duke, my master,	
My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.	
By his authority I will proclaim it	
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,	
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;	
He that conceals him, death.	
EDMUND	
When I dissuaded him from his intent,	
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech	
I threatened to discover him. He replied,	
‘ Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,	
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal	
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee	
Make thy words faithed? No, what I should deny –	
As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce	
My very character – I'd turn it all	
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;	
And thou must make a dullard of the world	
If they not thought the profits of my death	
Were very pregnant and potential spurs	
To make thee seek it.’	
GLOUCESTER	
O strange and fastened villain!	
Would he deny his letter, said he? I never got him.	
Tucket within	
Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes. –	
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape.	
The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture	
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom	
May have due note of him; and of my land,	
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means	
To make thee capable.	
Enter Cornwall, Regan, and attendants	
CORNWALL	
How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither –	
Which I can call but now – I have heard strange news.	
REGAN	
If it be true, all vengeance comes too short	
Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?	
GLOUCESTER	
O madam, my old heart is cracked; it's cracked.	
REGAN	
What, did my father's godson seek your life?	
He whom my father named? your Edgar?	
GLOUCESTER	
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!	
REGAN	
Was he not companion with the riotous knights	
That tended upon my father?	
GLOUCESTER	
I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!	
EDMUND	
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.	
REGAN	
No marvel then though he were ill affected.	
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,	
To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.	
I have this present evening from my sister	
Been well informed of them, and with such cautions	
That if they come to sojourn at my house	
I'll not be there.	
CORNWALL	
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.	
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father	
A child-like office.	
EDMUND	
It was my duty, sir.	
GLOUCESTER	
He did bewray his practice, and received	
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.	
CORNWALL	
Is he pursued?	
GLOUCESTER	
Ay, my good lord.	
CORNWALL	
If he be taken he shall never more	
Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose	
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,	
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant	
So much commend itself, you shall be ours.	
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;	
You we first seize on.	
EDMUND	
I shall serve you, sir,	
Truly, however else.	
GLOUCESTER	
For him I thank your grace.	
CORNWALL	
You know not why we came to visit you –	
REGAN	
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night –	
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some price,	
Wherein we must have use of your advice.	
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,	
Of differences, which I best thought it fit	
To answer from our home. The several messengers	
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,	
Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow	
Your needful counsel to our businesses,	
Which craves the instant use.	
GLOUCESTER	
I serve you, madam.	
Your graces are right welcome.

Act 2, scene 2
Enter Kent and Oswald by opposite doors	
OSWALD	
Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?	
KENT	
Ay.	
OSWALD	
Where may we set our horses?	
KENT	
I'the mire.	
OSWALD	
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.	
KENT	
I love thee not.	
OSWALD	
Why then, I care not for thee.	
KENT	
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee	
care for me.	
OSWALD	
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.	
KENT	
Fellow, I know thee.	
OSWALD	
What dost thou know me for?	
KENT	
A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats, a base,	
proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,	
filthy-worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking,	
whoreson glass-gazing super-serviceable finical	
rogue, one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a	
bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the	
composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and	
the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will	
beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least	
syllable of thy addition.	
OSWALD	
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail	
on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!	
KENT	
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou	
knowest me! Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels	
and beat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue! For	
though it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop	
o'the moonshine of you, you whoreson cullionly	
barber-monger! Draw!	
He brandishes his sword	
OSWALD	
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.	
KENT	
Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the	
King, and take Vanity the puppet's part against the	
royalty of her father. Draw, you rogue! or I'll so	
carbonado your shanks – Draw, you rascal! Come your	
ways!	
OSWALD	
Help, ho! Murder! Help!	
KENT	
Strike, you slave!	
Oswald tries to escape	
Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave! Strike!	
He beats him	
OSWALD	
Help, ho! Murder! Murder!	
Enter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, and	
servants	
EDMUND	
How now! What's the matter? Part!	
KENT	
With you, goodman boy, and you please! Come, I'll	
flesh ye; come on, young master.	
GLOUCESTER	
Weapons? Arms? What's the matter here?	
CORNWALL	
Keep peace, upon your lives!	
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?	
REGAN	
The messengers from our sister and the King –	
CORNWALL	
What is your difference? Speak.	
OSWALD	
I am scarce in breath, my lord.	
KENT	
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You	
cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made	
thee.	
CORNWALL	
Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a	
man?	
KENT	
Ay tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or a painter could not	
have made him so ill, though they had been but two	
years o'the trade.	
CORNWALL	
(to Oswald)	
Speak yet, how grew your	
quarrel?	
OSWALD	
This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have	
spared at suit of his grey beard –	
KENT	
Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter! My	
lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted	
villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him.	
‘ Spare my grey beard,’ you wagtail!	
CORNWALL	
Peace, sirrah!	
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?	
KENT	
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.	
CORNWALL	
Why art thou angry?	
KENT	
That such a slave as this should wear a sword	
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,	
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain,	
Which are t' intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion	
That in the natures of their lords rebel,	
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods,	
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks	
With every gale and vary of their masters,	
Knowing naught – like dogs – but following. –	
A plague upon your epileptic visage!	
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?	
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum Plain,	
I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot.	
CORNWALL	
What, art thou mad, old fellow?	
GLOUCESTER	
How fell you out? Say that.	
KENT	
No contraries hold more antipathy	
Than I and such a knave.	
CORNWALL	
Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?	
KENT	
His countenance likes me not.	
CORNWALL	
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.	
KENT	
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.	
I have seen better faces in my time	
Than stands on any shoulder that I see	
Before me at this instant.	
CORNWALL	
This is some fellow	
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect	
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb	
Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!	
An honest mind and plain – he must speak truth!	
And they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.	
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness	
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends	
Than twenty silly-ducking observants	
That stretch their duties nicely.	
KENT	
Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,	
Under th' allowance of your great aspect,	
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire	
On flickering Phoebus' front –	
CORNWALL	
What mean'st by this?	
KENT	
To go out of my dialect which you discommend so	
much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguiled	
you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which, for my	
part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure	
to entreat me to't.	
CORNWALL	
What was th' offence you gave him?	
OSWALD	
I never gave him any.	
It pleased the King his master very late	
To strike at me upon his misconstruction,	
When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,	
Tripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,	
And put upon him such a deal of man	
That worthied him, got praises of the King	
For him attempting who was self-subdued;	
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit	
Drew on me here again.	
KENT	
None of these rogues and cowards	
But Ajax is their fool.	
CORNWALL	
Fetch forth the stocks!	
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,	
We'll teach you –	
KENT	
Sir, I am too old to learn.	
Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King,	
On whose employment I was sent to you.	
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice	
Against the grace and person of my master,	
Stocking his messenger.	
CORNWALL	
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,	
There shall he sit till noon.	
REGAN	
Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too.	
KENT	
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog	
You should not use me so.	
REGAN	
Sir, being his knave, I will.	
CORNWALL	
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour	
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks.	
Stocks brought out	
GLOUCESTER	
Let me beseech your grace not to do so.	
His fault is much, and the good King, his master,	
Will check him for't. Your purposed low correction	
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches	
For pilferings and most common trespasses	
Are punished with. The King must take it ill	
That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,	
Should have him thus restrained.	
CORNWALL	
I'll answer that.	
REGAN	
My sister may receive it much more worse	
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,	
For following her affairs. – Put in his legs.	
Kent is put in the stocks	
Come, my lord, away.	
Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent	
GLOUCESTER	
I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,	
Whose disposition all the world well knows	
Will not be rubbed nor stopped. I'll entreat for thee.	
KENT	
Pray do not, sir. I have watched and travelled hard.	
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.	
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.	
Give you good morrow!	
GLOUCESTER	
The Duke's to blame in this.	
'Twill be ill taken.	
Exit	
KENT	
Good King, that must approve the common saw,	
Thou out of Heaven's benediction comest	
To the warm sun.	
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,	
That by thy comfortable beams I may	
Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles	
But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,	
Who hath most fortunately been informed	
(reading)	
Of my obscured course, and ‘ shall find time	
From this enormous state, seeking to give	
Losses their remedies.’ All weary and o'erwatched,	
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold	
This shameful lodging.	
Fortune, good night: smile once more; turn thy wheel.	
He sleeps	
Act 2, scene 3
Enter Edgar	
EDGAR	
I heard myself proclaimed,	
And by the happy hollow of a tree	
Escaped the hunt. No port is free, no place	
That guard and most unusual vigilance	
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape	
I will preserve myself; and am bethought	
To take the basest and most poorest shape	
That ever penury, in contempt of man,	
Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,	
Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,	
And with presented nakedness outface	
The winds and persecutions of the sky.	
The country gives me proof and precedent	
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,	
Strike in their numbed and mortified bare arms	
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;	
And with this horrible object, from low farms,	
Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills	
Sometimes with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,	
Enforce their charity: ‘ Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom!’	
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.	
Exit	
Act 2, scene 4
Kent still in the stocks	
Enter Lear, the Fool, and a Gentleman	
LEAR	
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home	
And not send back my messengers.	
GENTLEMAN	
As I learned,	
The night before there was no purpose in them	
Of this remove.	
KENT	
Hail to thee, noble master!	
LEAR	
Ha!	
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?	
KENT	
No, my lord.	
FOOL	
Ha, ha! He wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by	
the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the	
loins, and men by the legs. When a man's overlusty at	
legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks.	
LEAR	
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook	
To set thee here?	
KENT	
It is both he and she;	
Your son and daughter.	
LEAR	
No.	
KENT	
Yes.	
LEAR	
No, I say.	
KENT	
I say yea.	
LEAR	
No, no, they would not.	
KENT	
Yes, they have.	
LEAR	
By Jupiter, I swear no!	
KENT	
By Juno, I swear ay!	
LEAR	
They durst not do't;	
They could not, would not do't; 'tis worse than murder	
To do upon respect such violent outrage.	
Resolve me with all modest haste which way	
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,	
Coming from us.	
KENT	
My lord, when at their home	
I did commend your highness' letters to them,	
Ere I was risen from the place that showed	
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,	
Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth	
From Gonerill his mistress salutations;	
Delivered letters, spite of intermission,	
Which presently they read; on whose contents	
They summoned up their meiny, straight took horse,	
Commanded me to follow and attend	
The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks;	
And meeting here the other messenger,	
Whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine –	
Being the very fellow which of late	
Displayed so saucily against your highness –	
Having more man than wit about me, drew.	
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.	
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth	
The shame which here it suffers.	
FOOL	
Winter's not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way.	
Fathers that wear rags	
Do make their children blind,	
But fathers that bear bags	
Shall see their children kind.	
Fortune, that arrant whore,	
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.	
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy	
daughters as thou canst tell in a year.	
LEAR	
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!	
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow!	
Thy element's below. Where is this daughter?	
KENT	
With the Earl, sir, here within.	
LEAR	
Follow me not; stay here.	
Exit	
GENTLEMAN	
Made you no more offence but what you speak of?	
KENT	
None.	
How chance the King comes with so small a number?	
FOOL	
And thou hadst been set i'the stocks for that question,	
thou'dst well deserved it.	
KENT	
Why, Fool?	
FOOL	
We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee	
there's no labouring i'the winter. All that follow their	
noses are led by their eyes, but blind men; and there's	
not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's	
stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down	
a hill, lest it break thy neck with following. But the great	
one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. When a	
wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again;	
I would ha' none but knaves use it, since a fool gives it.	
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,	
And follows but for form,	
Will pack when it begins to rain,	
And leave thee in the storm;	
But I will tarry, the fool will stay,	
And let the wise man fly.	
The knave turns fool that runs away;	
The fool no knave, perdy.	
KENT	
Where learned you this, Fool?	
FOOL	
Not i'the stocks, fool.	
Enter Lear and Gloucester	
LEAR	
Deny to speak with me? They are sick; they are weary?	
They have travelled all the night? Mere fetches,	
The images of revolt and flying-off.	
Fetch me a better answer.	
GLOUCESTER	
My dear lord,	
You know the fiery quality of the Duke,	
How unremovable and fixed he is	
In his own course.	
LEAR	
Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!	
‘ Fiery ’? What ‘ quality ’? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,	
I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.	
GLOUCESTER	
Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.	
LEAR	
‘ Informed them ’! Dost thou understand me, man?	
GLOUCESTER	
Ay, my good lord.	
LEAR	
The King would speak with Cornwall, the dear father	
Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends, service.	
Are they ‘ informed ’ of this? My breath and blood!	
‘ Fiery ’? The ‘ fiery ’ Duke? Tell the hot Duke that –	
No, but not yet! Maybe he is not well.	
Infirmity doth still neglect all office	
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves	
When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind	
To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;	
And am fallen out with my more headier will	
To take the indisposed and sickly fit	
For the sound man. – Death on my state! wherefore	
Should he sit here? This act persuades me	
That this remotion of the Duke and her	
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.	
Go tell the Duke and's wife I'd speak with them –	
Now presently! Bid them come forth and hear me,	
Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum	
Till it cry sleep to death.	
GLOUCESTER	
I would have all well betwixt you.	
Exit	
LEAR	
O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!	
FOOL	
Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels	
when she put 'em i'the paste alive. She knapped 'em	
o'the coxcombs with a stick and cried ‘ Down, wantons,	
down!’ 'Twas her brother that in pure kindness to his	
horse buttered his hay.	
Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, and servants	
LEAR	
Good morrow to you both.	
CORNWALL	
Hail to your grace.	
Kent is here set at liberty	
REGAN	
I am glad to see your highness.	
LEAR	
Regan, I think you are. I know what reason	
I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,	
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,	
Sepulchring an adult'ress. (To Kent) O, are you free?	
Some other time for that. – Beloved Regan,	
Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied	
Sharp-toothed unkindness like a vulture here –	
(laying his hand on his heart)	
I can scarce speak to thee – thou'lt not believe	
With how depraved a quality – O Regan!	
REGAN	
I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope	
You less know how to value her desert	
Than she to scant her duty.	
LEAR	
Say? How is that?	
REGAN	
I cannot think my sister in the least	
Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance,	
She have restrained the riots of your followers,	
'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end	
As clears her from all blame.	
LEAR	
My curses on her.	
REGAN	
O sir, you are old.	
Nature in you stands on the very verge	
Of his confine. You should be ruled and led	
By some discretion that discerns your state	
Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you	
That to our sister you do make return.	
Say you have wronged her.	
LEAR	
Ask her forgiveness?	
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:	
(he kneels)	
‘ Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;	
Age is unnecessary; on my knees I beg	
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’	
REGAN	
Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.	
Return you to my sister.	
LEAR	
(rising)	
Never, Regan.	
She hath abated me of half my train,	
Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue,	
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.	
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall	
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,	
You taking airs, with lameness!	
CORNWALL	
Fie, sir, fie!	
LEAR	
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames	
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,	
You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun,	
To fall and blister.	
REGAN	
O the blest gods!	
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.	
LEAR	
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.	
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give	
Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine	
Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee	
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,	
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,	
And in conclusion, to oppose the bolt	
Against my coming in. Thou better knowest	
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,	
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.	
Thy half o'the kingdom hast thou not forgot,	
Wherein I thee endowed.	
REGAN	
Good sir, to the purpose.	
LEAR	
Who put my man i'the stocks?	
Tucket within	
CORNWALL	
What trumpet's that?	
REGAN	
I know't – my sister's. This approves her letter	
That she would soon be here.	
Enter Oswald	
Is your lady come?	
LEAR	
This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride	
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.	
Out, varlet, from my sight!	
CORNWALL	
What means your grace?	
LEAR	
Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope	
Thou didst not know on't.	
Enter Gonerill	
Who comes here? O heavens!	
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway	
Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,	
Make it your cause! Send down and take my part!	
(To Gonerill)	
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?	
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?	
GONERILL	
Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?	
All's not offence that indiscretion finds	
And dotage terms so.	
LEAR	
O sides, you are too tough!	
Will you yet hold? – How came my man i'the stocks?	
CORNWALL	
I set him there, sir; but his own disorders	
Deserved much less advancement.	
LEAR	
You? Did you?	
REGAN	
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.	
If till the expiration of your month	
You will return and sojourn with my sister,	
Dismissing half your train, come then to me.	
I am now from home and out of that provision	
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.	
LEAR	
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed!	
No, rather I abjure all roofs and choose	
To wage against the enmity o'th' air,	
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl –	
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?	
Why, the hot-blooded France that dowerless took	
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought	
To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg	
To keep base life afoot. Return with her!	
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter	
To this detested groom.	
He points to Oswald	
GONERILL	
At your choice, sir.	
LEAR	
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.	
I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.	
We'll no more meet, no more see one another.	
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter –	
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,	
Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,	
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,	
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.	
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.	
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,	
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.	
Mend when thou canst, be better at thy leisure;	
I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,	
I and my hundred knights.	
REGAN	
Not altogether so.	
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided	
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;	
For those that mingle reason with your passion	
Must be content to think you old, and so –	
But she knows what she does.	
LEAR	
Is this well spoken?	
REGAN	
I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?	
Is it not well? What should you need of more?	
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger	
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house	
Should many people under two commands	
Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.	
GONERILL	
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance	
From those that she calls servants, or from mine?	
REGAN	
Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack ye,	
We could control them. If you will come to me,	
For now I spy a danger, I entreat you	
To bring but five-and-twenty; to no more	
Will I give place or notice.	
LEAR	
I gave you all –	
REGAN	
And in good time you gave it.	
LEAR	
Made you my guardians, my depositaries;	
But kept a reservation to be followed	
With such a number. What, must I come to you	
With five-and-twenty – Regan, said you so?	
REGAN	
And speak't again, my lord. No more with me.	
LEAR	
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favoured	
When others are more wicked. Not being the worst	
Stands in some rank of praise. (To Gonerill) I'll go with thee.	
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,	
And thou art twice her love.	
GONERILL	
Hear me, my lord;	
What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five	
To follow, in a house where twice so many	
Have a command to tend you?	
REGAN	
What need one?	
LEAR	
O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars	
Are in the poorest thing superfluous.	
Allow not nature more than nature needs –	
Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;	
If only to go warm were gorgeous,	
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,	
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But for true need, –	
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!	
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,	
As full of grief as age, wretched in both;	
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts	
Against their father, fool me not so much	
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,	
And let not women's weapons, water drops,	
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,	
I will have such revenges on you both	
That all the world shall – I will do such things –	
What they are yet I know not; but they shall be	
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep.	
No, I'll not weep.	
I have full cause of weeping;	
(storm and tempest)	
but this heart	
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws	
Or ere I'll weep. O Fool, I shall go mad!	
Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, the Fool, and Gentleman	
CORNWALL	
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.	
REGAN	
This house is little; the old man and's people	
Cannot be well bestowed.	
GONERILL	
'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest	
And must needs taste his folly.	
REGAN	
For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,	
But not one follower.	
GONERILL	
So am I purposed.	
Where is my lord of Gloucester?	
CORNWALL	
Followed the old man forth. He is returned.	
Enter Gloucester	
GLOUCESTER	
The King is in high rage.	
CORNWALL	
Whither is he going?	
GLOUCESTER	
He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.	
CORNWALL	
'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.	
GONERILL	
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.	
GLOUCESTER	
Alack, the night comes on and the bleak winds	
Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about	
There's scarce a bush.	
REGAN	
O sir, to wilful men	
The injuries that they themselves procure	
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.	
He is attended with a desperate train,	
And what they may incense him to, being apt	
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.	
CORNWALL	
Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night.	
My Regan counsels well. Come out o'the storm.	
Exeunt	
Act 3, scene 1
Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman by opposite	
doors	
KENT	
Who's there besides foul weather?	
GENTLEMAN	
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.	
KENT	
I know you. Where's the King?	
GENTLEMAN	
Contending with the fretful elements:	
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,	
Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,	
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,	
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage	
Catch in their fury and make nothing of:	
Strives in his little world of man to out-storm	
The to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.	
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,	
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf	
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs	
And bids what will take all.	
KENT	
But who is with him?	
GENTLEMAN	
None but the Fool, who labours to outjest	
His heart-struck injuries.	
KENT	
Sir, I do know you,	
And dare upon the warrant of my note	
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division –	
Although as yet the face of it is covered	
With mutual cunning – 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;	
Who have – as who have not that their great stars	
Throned and set high – servants, who seem no less,	
Which are to France the spies and speculations	
Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,	
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,	
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne	
Against the old kind King, or something deeper,	
Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings –	
But true it is, from France there comes a power	
Into this scattered kingdom, who already,	
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet	
In some of our best ports and are at point	
To show their open banner. Now to you:	
If on my credit you dare build so far	
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find	
Some that will thank you making just report	
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow	
The King hath cause to plain.	
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,	
And from some knowledge and assurance offer	
This office to you.	
GENTLEMAN	
I will talk further with you.	
KENT	
No, do not.	
For confirmation that I am much more	
Than my out-wall, open this purse and take	
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia –	
As fear not but you shall – show her this ring,	
And she will tell you who that fellow is	
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!	
I will go seek the King.	
GENTLEMAN	
Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?	
KENT	
Few words, but to effect more than all yet:	
That when we have found the King – in which your pain	
That way, I'll this – he that first lights on him	
Holla the other.	
Exeunt by opposite doors	
Act 3, scene 2
Storm still. Enter Lear and the Fool	
LEAR	
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow!	
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout	
Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!	
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,	
Vaunt-curriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,	
Singe my white head! And thou all-shaking thunder,	
Smite flat the thick rotundity o'the world,	
Crack Nature's moulds, all germens spill at once	
That makes ingrateful man!	
FOOL	
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better	
than this rain-water out o' door. Good nuncle, in; ask thy	
daughters' blessing. Here's a night pities neither wise	
men nor fools.	
LEAR	
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!	
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters.	
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;	
I never gave you kingdom, called you children.	
You owe me no subscription; then let fall	
Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand, your slave,	
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.	
But yet I call you servile ministers,	
That will with two pernicious daughters join	
Your high-engendered battles 'gainst a head	
So old and white as this. O, ho! 'Tis foul!	
FOOL	
He that has a house to put's head in has a good	
headpiece.	
The codpiece that will house	
Before the head has any,	
The head and he shall louse;	
So beggars marry many.	
The man that makes his toe	
What he his heart should make,	
Shall of a corn cry woe,	
And turn his sleep to wake.	
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths	
in a glass.	
Enter Kent	
LEAR	
No, I will be the pattern of all patience.	
I will say nothing.	
KENT	
Who's there?	
FOOL	
Marry, here's grace and a codpiece – that's a wise	
man and a fool.	
KENT	
Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night	
Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies	
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark	
And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,	
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,	
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never	
Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry	
Th' affliction nor the fear.	
LEAR	
Let the great gods	
That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads	
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch	
That hast within thee undivulged crimes	
Unwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,	
Thou perjured, and thou simular of virtue	
That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,	
That under covert and convenient seeming	
Hast practised on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,	
Rive your concealing continents, and cry	
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man	
More sinned against than sinning.	
KENT	
Alack, bare-headed?	
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;	
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.	
Repose you there while I to this hard house –	
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;	
Which even but now, demanding after you,	
Denied me to come in – return and force	
Their scanted courtesy.	
LEAR	
My wits begin to turn.	
Come on, my boy. How dost my boy? Art cold?	
I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?	
The art of our necessities is strange	
And can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.	
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart	
That's sorry yet for thee.	
FOOL	
(sings)	
He that has and a little tiny wit,	
With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain,	
Must make content with his fortunes fit,	
Though the rain it raineth every day.	
LEAR	
True, boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.	
Exeunt Lear and Kent	
FOOL	
This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak	
a prophecy ere I go:	
When priests are more in word than matter,	
When brewers mar their malt with water,	
When nobles are their tailors' tutors,	
No heretics burned but wenches' suitors –	
Then shall the realm of Albion	
Come to great confusion.	
When every case in law is right,	
No squire in debt nor no poor knight,	
When slanders do not live in tongues,	
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs,	
When usurers tell their gold i'the field,	
And bawds and whores do churches build –	
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,	
That going shall be used with feet.	
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his	
time.	
Exit	
Act 3, scene 3
Enter Gloucester and Edmund with lights	
GLOUCESTER	
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural	
dealing. When I desired their leave that I might	
pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house,	
charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure neither to	
speak of him, entreat for him, or any way sustain him.	
EDMUND	
Most savage and unnatural!	
GLOUCESTER	
Go to. Say you nothing. There is division	
between the Dukes; and a worse matter than that. I	
have received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be	
spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet. These injuries	
the King now bears will be revenged home. There	
is part of a power already footed. We must incline to the	
King. I will look him and privily relieve him. Go you	
and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not	
of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to	
bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the King	
my old master must be relieved. There is strange things	
toward, Edmund. Pray you, be careful.	
Exit	
EDMUND	
This courtesy forbid thee shall the Duke	
Instantly know, and of that letter too.	
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me	
That which my father loses – no less than all.	
The younger rises when the old doth fall.	
Exit	
Act 3, scene 4
Enter Lear, Kent, and the Fool	
KENT	
Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter.	
The tyranny of the open night's too rough	
For nature to endure.	
Storm still	
LEAR	
Let me alone.	
KENT	
Good my lord, enter here.	
LEAR	
Wilt break my heart?	
KENT	
I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.	
LEAR	
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm	
Invades us to the skin; so 'tis to thee.	
But where the greater malady is fixed,	
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;	
But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea	
Thou'dst meet the bear i'the mouth. When the mind's free	
The body's delicate; this tempest in my mind	
Doth from my senses take all feeling else	
Save what beats there. – Filial ingratitude!	
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand	
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home.	
No, I will weep no more! In such a night	
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.	
In such a night as this! O Regan, Gonerill!	
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!	
O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;	
No more of that!	
KENT	
Good my lord, enter here.	
LEAR	
Prithee go in thyself: seek thine own ease.	
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder	
On things would hurt me more; but I'll go in.	
(To the Fool)	
In, boy, go first. – You houseless poverty –	
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray and then I'll sleep.	
Exit the Fool	
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,	
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,	
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,	
Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you	
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en	
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;	
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,	
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them	
And show the heavens more just.	
EDGAR	
(within)	
Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!	
Enter the Fool from the hovel	
FOOL	
Come not in here, nuncle; here's a spirit. Help me,	
help me!	
KENT	
Give me thy hand. Who's there?	
FOOL	
A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's Poor Tom.	
KENT	
What art thou that dost grumble there i'the straw?	
Come forth.	
Enter Edgar disguised as Poor Tom	
EDGAR	
Away! The foul fiend follows me.	
Through the sharp hawthorn blow the cold winds.	
Humh! Go to thy bed and warm thee.	
LEAR	
Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou	
come to this?	
EDGAR	
Who gives anything to Poor Tom? whom the foul	
fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through	
ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire, that hath	
laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set	
ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart, to	
ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched bridges to	
course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits!	
Tom's a-cold. O do, de, do de, do, de. Bless thee from	
whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom	
some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I	
have him now, and there, and there again, and there.	
Storm still	
LEAR	
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?	
Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give 'em all?	
FOOL	
Nay, he reserved a blanket; else we had been all	
shamed.	
LEAR	
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air	
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!	
KENT	
He hath no daughters, sir.	
LEAR	
Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature	
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.	
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers	
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?	
Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot	
Those pelican daughters.	
EDGAR	
Pillicock sat on Pillicock Hill.	
Alow, alow, loo, loo!	
FOOL	
This cold night will turn us all to fools and	
madmen.	
EDGAR	
Take heed o'the foul fiend, obey thy parents, keep	
thy word's justice, swear not, commit not with man's	
sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array.	
Tom's a-cold.	
LEAR	
What hast thou been?	
EDGAR	
A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that	
curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of	
my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her,	
swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in	
the sweet face of heaven; one that slept in the contriving	
of lust and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice	
dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk – false	
of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in	
stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.	
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks	
betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of	
brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders'	
books, and defy the foul fiend.	
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind,	
Says suum, mun, nonny.	
Dolphin, my boy, boy, sesey! Let him trot by.	
Storm still	
LEAR	
Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with thy	
uncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no	
more than this? Consider him well. Thou owest the	
worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the	
cat no perfume. Ha! Here's three on's are sophisticated.	
Thou art the thing itself! Unaccommodated man is no	
more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.	
Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here.	
He tears off his clothes	
FOOL	
Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night	
to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an	
old lecher's heart – a small spark, all the rest on's body	
cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.	
Enter Gloucester with a torch	
EDGAR	
This is the foul fiend Flibberdigibbet. He begins	
at curfew and walks till the first cock. He gives the web	
and the pin, squenies the eye and makes the harelip,	
mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of	
earth.	
S'Withold footed thrice the 'old;	
He met the nightmare and her ninefold,	
Bid her alight and her troth plight –	
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!	
KENT	
How fares your grace?	
LEAR	
What's he?	
KENT	
(to Gloucester)	
Who's there? What is't you seek?	
GLOUCESTER	
What are you there? Your names?	
EDGAR	
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad,	
the todpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in the	
fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung	
for sallets, swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog,	
drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; who is	
whipped from tithing to tithing and stock-punished and	
imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six	
shirts to his body,	
Horse to ride and weapon to wear –	
But mice and rats and such small deer	
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.	
Beware my follower! Peace, Smulkin. Peace, thou fiend!	
GLOUCESTER	
What, hath your grace no better company?	
EDGAR	
The prince of darkness is a gentleman; Modo he's	
called and Mahu.	
GLOUCESTER	
Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile	
That it doth hate what gets it.	
EDGAR	
Poor Tom's a-cold.	
GLOUCESTER	
Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer	
T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands;	
Though their injunction be to bar my doors	
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,	
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out	
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.	
LEAR	
First let me talk with this philosopher.	
(To Edgar)	
What is the cause of thunder?	
KENT	
Good my lord,	
Take his offer, go into the house.	
LEAR	
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.	
(To Edgar)	
What is your study?	
EDGAR	
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.	
LEAR	
Let me ask you one word in private.	
Lear and Edgar talk apart	
KENT	
Importune him once more to go, my lord.	
His wits begin t' unsettle.	
GLOUCESTER	
Canst thou blame him? –	
(storm still)	
His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent,	
He said it would be thus, poor banished man!	
Thou sayest the King grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,	
I am almost mad myself. I had a son,	
Now outlawed from my blood; he sought my life	
But lately, very late. I loved him, friend,	
No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,	
The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this! –	
I do beseech your grace –	
LEAR	
O, cry you mercy, sir.	
(To Edgar)	
Noble philosopher, your company.	
EDGAR	
Tom's a-cold.	
GLOUCESTER	
In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee	
warm.	
LEAR	
Come, let's in all.	
KENT	
This way, my lord.	
LEAR	
With him!	
I will keep still with my philosopher.	
KENT	
Good my lord, soothe him: let him take the fellow.	
GLOUCESTER	
Take him you on.	
KENT	
Sirrah, come on. Go along with us.	
LEAR	
Come, good Athenian.	
GLOUCESTER	
No words, no words! Hush!	
EDGAR	
Child Roland to the dark tower came;	
His word was still ‘ Fie, foh, and fum,	
I smell the blood of a British man.’

Act 3, scene 5
Enter Cornwall and Edmund	
CORNWALL	
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.	
EDMUND	
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature	
thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.	
CORNWALL	
I now perceive it was not altogether your	
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death; but	
a provoking merit set a-work by a reprovable badness in	
himself.	
EDMUND	
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent	
to be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which approves	
him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O	
heavens! that this treason were not, or not I the	
detector.	
CORNWALL	
Go with me to the Duchess.	
EDMUND	
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have	
mighty business in hand.	
CORNWALL	
True or false, it hath made thee Earl of	
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be	
ready for our apprehension.	
EDMUND	
(aside)	
If I find him comforting the King it will	
stuff his suspicion more fully. (Aloud) I will persever in	
my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between	
that and my blood.	
CORNWALL	
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find	
a dearer father in my love.	
Exeunt	
Act 3, scene 6
Enter Kent and Gloucester	
GLOUCESTER	
Here is better than the open air. Take it	
thankfully; I will piece out the comfort with what	
addition I can. I will not be long from you.	
KENT	
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.	
The gods reward your kindness!	
Exit Gloucester	
Enter Lear, Edgar, and the Fool	
EDGAR	
Fraterretto calls me and tells me Nero is an angler	
in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the	
foul fiend.	
FOOL	
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a	
gentleman or a yeoman.	
LEAR	
A king, a king!	
FOOL	
No! He's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;	
for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman	
before him.	
LEAR	
To have a thousand with red burning spits	
Come hissing in upon 'em!	
EDGAR	
The foul fiend bites my back.	
FOOL	
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a	
horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.	
LEAR	
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.	
(To Edgar)	
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.	
(To the Fool)	
Thou sapient sir, sit here. No, you she-foxes –	
EDGAR	
Look where he stands and glares! Want'st thou	
eyes at trial, madam?	
(sings)	
Come o'er the burn, Bessy, to me.	
FOOL	
(sings)	
Her boat hath a leak	
And she must not speak	
Why she dares not come over to thee.	
EDGAR	
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a	
nightingale. Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two	
white herring. Croak not, black angel! I have no food for	
thee.	
KENT	
How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed.	
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushings?	
LEAR	
I'll see their trial first; bring in their evidence.	
(To Edgar)	
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place.	
(To the Fool)	
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,	
Bench by his side. (To Kent) You are o'the commission;	
Sit you too.	
EDGAR	
Let us deal justly.	
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?	
Thy sheep be in the corn,	
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth	
Thy sheep shall take no harm.	
Pur, the cat is grey.	
LEAR	
Arraign her first. 'Tis Gonerill! I here take my oath	
before this honourable assembly she kicked the poor	
King her father.	
FOOL	
Come hither, mistress. Is your name Gonerill?	
LEAR	
She cannot deny it.	
FOOL	
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.	
LEAR	
And here's another whose warped looks proclaim	
What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!	
Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!	
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?	
EDGAR	
Bless thy five wits!	
KENT	
O pity! Sir, where is the patience now	
That you so oft have boasted to retain?	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
My tears begin to take his part so much	
They mar my counterfeiting.	
LEAR	
The little dogs and all –	
Trey, Blanch, and Sweetheart – see, they bark at me.	
EDGAR	
Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you	
curs!	
Be thy mouth or black or white,	
Tooth that poisons if it bite,	
Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,	
Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,	
Or bobtail tike, or trundle-tail,	
Tom will make him weep and wail;	
For, with throwing thus my head,	
Dogs leapt the hatch and all are fled.	
Do de, de, de. Sese! Come, march to wakes and fairs	
and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.	
LEAR	
Then let them anatomize Regan, see what breeds	
about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes	
these hard hearts? You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred.	
Only I do not like the fashion of your garments.	
You will say they are Persian; but let them be changed.	
KENT	
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.	
LEAR	
Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.	
So, so. We'll to supper i'the morning.	
FOOL	
And I'll go to bed at noon.	
Enter Gloucester	
GLOUCESTER	
Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?	
KENT	
Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.	
GLOUCESTER	
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;	
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.	
There is a litter ready; lay him in't	
And drive toward Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet	
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master;	
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,	
With thine and all that offer to defend him,	
Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up,	
And follow me, that will to some provision	
Give thee quick conduct.	
KENT	
Oppressed nature sleeps.	
This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews	
Which, if convenience will not allow,	
Stand in hard cure. (To the Fool) Come, help to bear thy master.	
Thou must not stay behind.	
GLOUCESTER	
Come, come, away!	
Exeunt Kent, Gloucester, and the Fool,	
bearing off the King	
EDGAR	
When we our betters see bearing our woes,	
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.	
Who alone suffers, suffers most i'the mind,	
Leaving free things and happy shows behind;	
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip	
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.	
How light and portable my pain seems now,	
When that which makes me bend makes the King bow –	
He childed as I fathered. Tom, away!	
Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray	
When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee,	
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.	
What will hap more tonight, safe 'scape the King!	
Lurk, lurk!	
Exit	
Act 3, scene 7
Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gonerill, Edmund, and	
servants	
CORNWALL	
(to Gonerill)	
Post speedily to my lord your	
husband, show him this letter. The army of France is	
landed. – Seek out the traitor Gloucester.	
Exeunt some servants	
REGAN	
Hang him instantly!	
GONERILL	
Pluck out his eyes!	
CORNWALL	
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep	
you our sister company; the revenges we are bound to	
take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.	
Advise the Duke where you are going to a most	
festinate preparation; we are bound to the like. Our	
posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. Farewell,	
dear sister. Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.	
Enter Oswald	
How now? Where's the King?	
OSWALD	
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.	
Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,	
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,	
Who with some other of the lord's dependants	
Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast	
To have well-armed friends.	
CORNWALL	
Get horses for your mistress.	
Exit Oswald	
GONERILL	
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.	
CORNWALL	
Edmund, farewell.	
Exeunt Gonerill and Edmund	
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.	
Pinion him like a thief; bring him before us.	
Exeunt servants	
Though well we may not pass upon his life	
Without the form of justice, yet our power	
Shall do a curtsy to our wrath, which men	
May blame but not control.	
Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three servants	
Who's there? The traitor?	
REGAN	
Ingrateful fox, 'tis he!	
CORNWALL	
Bind fast his corky arms.	
GLOUCESTER	
What means your graces? Good my friends, consider	
You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.	
CORNWALL	
Bind him, I say.	
Servants tie his hands	
REGAN	
Hard, hard! O filthy traitor!	
GLOUCESTER	
Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.	
CORNWALL	
To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find –	
Regan plucks his beard	
GLOUCESTER	
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done	
To pluck me by the beard.	
REGAN	
So white, and such a traitor!	
GLOUCESTER	
Naughty lady,	
These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin	
Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host;	
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours	
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?	
CORNWALL	
Come, sir; what letters had you late from France?	
REGAN	
Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.	
CORNWALL	
And what confederacy have you with the traitors	
Late footed in the kingdom –	
REGAN	
To whose hands you have sent the lunatic King? Speak!	
GLOUCESTER	
I have a letter guessingly set down	
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart	
And not from one opposed.	
CORNWALL	
Cunning.	
REGAN	
And false.	
CORNWALL	
Where hast thou sent the King?	
GLOUCESTER	
To Dover.	
REGAN	
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril –	
CORNWALL	
Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.	
GLOUCESTER	
I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.	
REGAN	
Wherefore to Dover?	
GLOUCESTER	
Because I would not see thy cruel nails	
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister	
In his anointed flesh rash boarish fangs.	
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head	
In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up	
And quenched the stelled fires;	
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.	
If wolves had at thy gate howled that dern time	
Thou shouldst have said, ‘ Good porter, turn the key;	
All cruels else subscribe.’ But I shall see	
The winged Vengeance overtake such children.	
CORNWALL	
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.	
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.	
GLOUCESTER	
He that will think to live till he be old,	
Give me some help! – O, cruel! O, you gods!	
REGAN	
One side will mock another. Th' other too!	
CORNWALL	
If you see Vengeance –	
FIRST SERVANT	
Hold your hand, my lord!	
I have served you ever since I was a child;	
But better service have I never done you	
Than now to bid you hold.	
REGAN	
How now, you dog!	
FIRST SERVANT	
If you did wear a beard upon your chin	
I'd shake it on this quarrel.	
(Cornwall draws his sword)	
What do you mean?	
CORNWALL	
My villain!	
He lunges at him	
FIRST SERVANT	
(drawing his sword)	
Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.	
He wounds Cornwall	
REGAN	
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!	
She takes a sword and runs at him behind	
FIRST SERVANT	
O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left	
To see some mischief on him. O!	
He dies	
CORNWALL	
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!	
Where is thy lustre now?	
GLOUCESTER	
All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?	
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature	
To quit this horrid act.	
REGAN	
Out, treacherous villain!	
Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he	
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;	
Who is too good to pity thee.	
GLOUCESTER	
O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.	
Kind gods, forgive me that and prosper him.	
REGAN	
Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell	
His way to Dover.	
Exit a servant with Gloucester	
How is't, my lord? How look you?	
CORNWALL	
I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.	
Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave	
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.	
Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.	
Exit Cornwall, supported by Regan	
SECOND SERVANT	
I'll never care what wickedness I do	
If this man come to good.	
THIRD SERVANT	
If she live long,	
And in the end meet the old course of death,	
Women will all turn monsters.	
SECOND SERVANT	
Let's follow the old Earl, and get the Bedlam	
To lead him where he would; his roguish madness	
Allows itself to anything.	
THIRD SERVANT	
Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs	
To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!	
Exeunt by opposite doors	
Act 4, scene 1
Enter Edgar	
EDGAR	
Yet better thus, and known to be contemned,	
Than still contemned and flattered. To be worst,	
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,	
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.	
The lamentable change is from the best;	
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,	
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!	
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst	
Owes nothing to thy blasts.	
Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man	
But who comes here?	
My father, parti-eyed! World, world, O world!	
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee	
Life would not yield to age.	
OLD MAN	
O my good lord,	
I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant	
These fourscore years!	
GLOUCESTER	
Away! Get thee away! Good friend, be gone.	
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;	
Thee they may hurt.	
OLD MAN	
You cannot see your way.	
GLOUCESTER	
I have no way and therefore want no eyes;	
I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen	
Our means secure us, and our mere defects	
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,	
The food of thy abused father's wrath!	
Might I but live to see thee in my touch	
I'd say I had eyes again.	
OLD MAN	
How now? Who's there?	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
O gods! Who is't can say ‘ I am at the worst ’?	
I am worse than e'er I was.	
OLD MAN	
'Tis poor mad Tom.	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
And worse I may be yet. The worst is not,	
So long as we can say ‘ This is the worst.’	
OLD MAN	
Fellow, where goest?	
GLOUCESTER	
Is it a beggar-man?	
OLD MAN	
Madman and beggar too.	
GLOUCESTER	
He has some reason, else he could not beg.	
I'the last night's storm I such a fellow saw	
Which made me think a man a worm. My son	
Came then into my mind, and yet my mind	
Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.	
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods;	
They kill us for their sport.	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
How should this be?	
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,	
Angering itself and others. (Aloud) Bless thee, master!	
GLOUCESTER	
Is that the naked fellow?	
OLD MAN	
Ay, my lord.	
GLOUCESTER	
Then prithee get thee away. If for my sake	
Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain,	
I'the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,	
And bring some covering for this naked soul,	
Who I'll entreat to lead me.	
OLD MAN	
Alack, sir, he is mad.	
GLOUCESTER	
'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.	
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.	
Above the rest, begone.	
OLD MAN	
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have.	
Come on't what will.	
Exit	
GLOUCESTER	
Sirrah naked fellow!	
EDGAR	
Poor Tom's a-cold. (Aside) I cannot daub it further.	
GLOUCESTER	
Come hither, fellow.	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
And yet I must. (Aloud) Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.	
GLOUCESTER	
Knowest thou the way to Dover?	
EDGAR	
Both stile and gate, horse-way and footpath, Poor	
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits. Bless thee,	
good man's son, from the foul fiend. Five fiends have	
been in Poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence,	
prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing;	
Modo, of murder; Flibberdigibbet, of mopping and	
mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and	
waiting-women. So bless thee, master!	
GLOUCESTER	
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues	
Have humbled to all strokes:. That I am wretched	
Makes thee the happier. Heavens deal so still!	
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man	
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see	
Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly!	
So distribution should undo excess	
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?	
EDGAR	
Ay, master.	
GLOUCESTER	
There is a cliff whose high and bending head	
Looks fearfully in the confined deep;	
Bring me but to the very brim of it	
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear	
With something rich about me. From that place	
I shall no leading need.	
EDGAR	
Give me thy arm;	
Poor Tom shall lead thee.	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 2
Enter Gonerill and Edmund	
GONERILL	
Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband	
Not met us on the way.	
Enter Oswald	
Now, where's your master'?	
OSWALD	
Madam, within; but never man so changed.	
I told him of the army that was landed.	
He smiled at it. I told him you were coming.	
His answer was ‘The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery	
And of the loyal service of his son	
When I informed him, then he called me sot	
And told me I had turned the wrong side out.	
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;	
What like, offensive.	
GONERILL	
(to Edmund)	
Then shall you go no further.	
It is the cowish terror of his spirit	
That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs	
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way	
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother!	
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:	
I must change arms at home and give the distaff	
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant	
Shall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,	
If you dare venture in your own behalf,	
A mistress's command. Wear this; (giving a favour) spare speech.	
Decline your head; this kiss, if it durst speak,	
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.	
Conceive; and fare thee well.	
EDMUND	
Yours in the ranks of death.	
GONERILL	
My most dear Gloucester!	
Exit Edmund	
O, the difference of man and man!	
To thee a woman's services are due;	
A fool usurps my bed.	
OSWALD	
Madam, here comes my lord.	
Exit	
Enter Albany	
GONERILL	
I have been worth the whistling.	
ALBANY	
O Gonerill,	
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind	
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:	
That nature which contemns its origin	
Cannot be bordered certain in itself.	
She that herself will sliver and disbranch	
From her material sap perforce must wither	
And come to deadly use.	
GONERILL	
No more; the text is foolish.	
ALBANY	
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;	
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done,	
Tigers not daughters, what have you performed?	
A father, and a gracious aged man,	
Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick,	
Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.	
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?	
A man, a prince, by him so benefited?	
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits	
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,	
It will come –	
Humanity must perforce prey on itself	
Like monsters of the deep.	
GONERILL	
Milk-livered man!	
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs!	
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning	
Thine honour from thy suffering, that not knowest	
Fools do those villains pity who are punished	
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?	
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,	
With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,	
Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries	
‘ Alack, why does he so?’	
ALBANY	
See thyself, devil!	
Proper deformity shows not in the fiend	
So horrid as in woman.	
GONERILL	
O vain fool!	
ALBANY	
Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame,	
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness	
To let these hands obey my blood,	
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear	
Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,	
A woman's shape doth shield thee.	
GONERILL	
Marry, your manhood! Mew!	
Enter a Messenger	
ALBANY	
What news?	
MESSENGER	
O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead,	
Slain by his servant, going to put out	
The other eye of Gloucester.	
ALBANY	
Gloucester's eyes?	
MESSENGER	
A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,	
Opposed against the act, bending his sword	
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,	
Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead,	
But not without that harmful stroke which since	
Hath plucked him after.	
ALBANY	
This shows you are above,	
You justicers, that these our nether crimes	
So speedily can venge! But, O, poor Gloucester!	
Lost he his other eye?	
MESSENGER	
Both, both, my lord.	
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.	
'Tis from your sister.	
GONERILL	
(aside)	
One way I like this well.	
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,	
May all the building in my fancy pluck	
Upon my hateful life. Another way	
The news is not so tart. – (Aloud) I'll read and answer.	
Exit	
ALBANY	
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?	
MESSENGER	
Come with my lady hither.	
ALBANY	
He is not here.	
MESSENGER	
No, my good lord; I met him back again.	
ALBANY	
Knows he the wickedness?	
MESSENGER	
Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he informed against him,	
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment	
Might have the freer course.	
ALBANY	
Gloucester, I live	
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King	
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend;	
Tell me what more thou knowest.	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 3
Enter Kent and a Gentleman	
KENT	
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back	
know you no reason?	
GENTLEMAN	
Something he left imperfect in the state,	
which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports	
to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his	
personal return was most required and necessary.	
KENT	
Who hath he left behind him general?	
GENTLEMAN	
The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.	
KENT	
Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration	
of grief?	
GENTLEMAN	
Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence,	
And now and then an ample tear trilled down	
Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen	
Over her passion who, most rebel-like,	
Sought to be king o'er her.	
KENT	
O, then it moved her?	
GENTLEMAN	
Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove	
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen	
Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears	
Were like a better way; those happy smilets	
That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know	
What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence	
As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,	
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved	
If all could so become it.	
KENT	
Made she no verbal question?	
GENTLEMAN	
Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of father	
Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart,	
Cried ‘ Sisters! Sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!	
Kent! Father! Sisters! – What, i'the storm? i'the night?	
Let pity not be believed!’ There she shook	
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,	
And clamour moistened; then away she started	
To deal with grief alone.	
KENT	
It is the stars,	
The stars above us govern our conditions.	
Else one self mate and make could not beget	
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?	
GENTLEMAN	
No.	
KENT	
Was this before the King returned?	
GENTLEMAN	
No, since.	
KENT	
Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i'the town,	
Who sometime in his better tune remembers	
What we are come about, and by no means	
Will yield to see his daughter.	
GENTLEMAN	
Why, good sir?	
KENT	
A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness	
That stripped her from his benediction, turned her	
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights	
To his dog-hearted daughters – these things sting	
His mind so venomously that burning shame	
Detains him from Cordelia.	
GENTLEMAN	
Alack, poor gentleman!	
KENT	
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?	
GENTLEMAN	
'Tis so. They are afoot.	
KENT	
Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear	
And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause	
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.	
When I am known aright you shall not grieve	
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you	
Go along with me.	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 4
Enter, with drum and colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and	
soldiers	
CORDELIA	
Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now	
As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,	
Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,	
With hardokes, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,	
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow	
In our sustaining corn. (To soldiers) A century send forth;	
Search every acre in the high-grown field	
And bring him to our eye.	
Exeunt soldiers	
(To Doctor)	
What can man's wisdom	
In the restoring his bereaved sense?	
He that helps him, take all my outward worth.	
DOCTOR	
There is means, madam.	
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,	
The which he lacks; that to provoke in him	
Are many simples operative, whose power	
Will close the eye of anguish.	
CORDELIA	
All blest secrets,	
All you unpublished virtues of the earth,	
Spring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate	
In the good man's distress. Seek, seek for him,	
Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life	
That wants the means to lead it.	
Enter a Messenger	
MESSENGER	
News, madam:	
The British powers are marching hitherward.	
CORDELIA	
'Tis known before. Our preparation stands	
In expectation of them. O dear father,	
It is thy business that I go about.	
Therefore great France	
My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.	
No blown ambition doth our arms incite	
But love, dear love, and our aged father's right.	
Soon may I hear and see him!	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 5
Enter Regan and Oswald	
REGAN	
But are my brother's powers set forth?	
OSWALD	
Ay, madam.	
REGAN	
Himself in person there?	
OSWALD	
Madam, with much ado.	
Your sister is the better soldier.	
REGAN	
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?	
OSWALD	
No, madam.	
REGAN	
What might import my sister's letter to him?	
OSWALD	
I know not, lady.	
REGAN	
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.	
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,	
To let him live. Where he arrives he moves	
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,	
In pity of his misery, to dispatch	
His nighted life – moreover to descry	
The strength o'th' enemy.	
OSWALD	
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.	
REGAN	
Our troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us.	
The ways are dangerous.	
OSWALD	
I may not, madam.	
My lady charged my duty in this business.	
REGAN	
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you	
Transport her purposes by word? Belike –	
Some things – I know not what – I'll love thee much –	
Let me unseal the letter.	
OSWALD	
Madam, I had rather –	
REGAN	
I know your lady does not love her husband –	
I am sure of that – and at her late being here	
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks	
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.	
OSWALD	
I, madam?	
REGAN	
I speak in understanding. Y'are; I know't.	
Therefore I do advise you take this note:	
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,	
And more convenient is he for my hand	
Than for your lady's. You may gather more.	
If you do find him, pray you give him this;	
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,	
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.	
So fare you well.	
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,	
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.	
OSWALD	
Would I could meet him, madam! I should show	
What party I do follow.	
REGAN	
Fare thee well.	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 6
Enter Gloucester and Edgar in peasant's clothes	
GLOUCESTER	
When shall I come to the top of that same hill?	
EDGAR	
You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.	
GLOUCESTER	
Methinks the ground is even.	
EDGAR	
Horrible steep.	
Hark, do you hear the sea?	
GLOUCESTER	
No, truly.	
EDGAR	
Why then your other senses grow imperfect	
By your eyes' anguish.	
GLOUCESTER	
So may it be indeed.	
Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak'st	
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.	
EDGAR	
Y'are much deceived. In nothing am I changed	
But in my garments.	
GLOUCESTER	
Methinks y'are better spoken.	
EDGAR	
Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still! How fearful	
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!	
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air	
Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down	
Hangs one that gathers sampire – dreadful trade!	
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.	
The fishermen that walk upon the beach	
Appear like mice, and yon tall anchoring bark,	
Diminished to her cock; her cock, a buoy	
Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge	
That on th' unnumbered idle pebble chafes	
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,	
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight	
Topple down headlong.	
GLOUCESTER	
Set me where you stand.	
EDGAR	
Give me your hand. You are now within a foot	
Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon	
Would I not leap upright.	
GLOUCESTER	
Let go my hand.	
Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel	
Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods	
Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off.	
Bid me farewell; and let me hear thee going.	
EDGAR	
Now fare ye well, good sir.	
GLOUCESTER	
With all my heart.	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
Why I do trifle thus with his despair	
Is done to cure it.	
GLOUCESTER	
(kneeling)	
O you mighty gods!	
This world I do renounce, and in your sights	
Shake patiently my great affliction off.	
If I could bear it longer and not fall	
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,	
My snuff and loathed part of nature should	
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!	
Now, fellow, fare thee well.	
EDGAR	
Gone, sir. Farewell.	
Gloucester throws himself forward	
And yet I know not how conceit may rob	
The treasury of life, when life itself	
Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,	
By this had thought been past. – Alive or dead?	
Ho, you, sir! Friend! Hear you, sir? Speak! –	
Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives –	
What are you, sir?	
GLOUCESTER	
Away, and let me die.	
EDGAR	
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,	
So many fathom down precipitating,	
Thou'dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost breathe,	
Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound.	
Ten masts at each make not the altitude	
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.	
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.	
GLOUCESTER	
But have I fallen or no?	
EDGAR	
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.	
Look up a-height. The shrill-gorged lark so far	
Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.	
GLOUCESTER	
Alack, I have no eyes.	
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit	
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort	
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage	
And frustrate his proud will.	
EDGAR	
Give me your arm.	
Up – so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.	
GLOUCESTER	
Too well, too well.	
EDGAR	
This is above all strangeness.	
Upon the crown o'the cliff what thing was that	
Which parted from you?	
GLOUCESTER	
A poor unfortunate beggar.	
EDGAR	
As I stood here below methought his eyes	
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,	
Horns welked and waved like the enridged sea.	
It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,	
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours	
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.	
GLOUCESTER	
I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear	
Affliction till it do cry out itself	
‘ Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of,	
I took it for a man; often 'twould say	
‘ The fiend, the fiend;’ he led me to that place.	
EDGAR	
Bear free and patient thoughts.	
Enter Lear fantastically dressed with wild flowers	
But who comes here?	
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate	
His master thus.	
LEAR	
No, they cannot touch me for coining.; I am the	
King himself.	
EDGAR	
O thou side-piercing sight!	
LEAR	
Nature's above art in that respect. There's your	
press-money. – That fellow handles his bow like a	
crow-keeper. – Draw me a clothier's yard. – Look, look, a	
mouse! – Peace, peace! this piece of toasted cheese will	
do't. – There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. –	
Bring up the brown bills. – O, well flown, bird! I'the	
clout, i' the clout! Hewgh! – Give the word.	
EDGAR	
Sweet marjoram.	
LEAR	
Pass.	
GLOUCESTER	
I know that voice.	
He falls to his knees	
LEAR	
Ha! Gonerill with a white beard! They flattered me	
like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in my beard.	
ere the black ones were there. To say ‘ ay ’ and ‘ no ’ to	
everything that I said! ‘Ay' and ‘no' too was no good	
divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the	
wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not	
peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt	
'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words. They	
told me I was everything. 'Tis a lie: I am not	
ague-proof.	
GLOUCESTER	
The trick of that voice I do well remember.	
Is't not the King?	
LEAR	
Ay, every inch a king.	
When I do stare see how the subject quakes.	
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?	
Adultery?	
Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.	
The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly	
Does lecher in my sight.	
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son	
Was kinder to his father than my daughters	
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.	
To't, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers.	
Behold yon simpering dame	
Whose face between her forks presages snow,	
That minces virtue and does shake the head	
To hear of pleasure's name –	
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't	
With a more riotous appetite.	
Down from the waist they are centaurs,	
Though women all above;	
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,	
Beneath is all the fiends' –	
There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous	
pit – burning, scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie,	
fie! Pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,	
sweeten my imagination. There's money for	
thee.	
He gives flowers	
GLOUCESTER	
O, let me kiss that hand!	
LEAR	
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.	
GLOUCESTER	
O ruined piece of nature! This great world	
Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?	
LEAR	
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou	
squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I'll not	
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning	
of it.	
GLOUCESTER	
Were all the letters suns, I could not see.	
EDGAR	
(aside)	
I would not take this from report. It is;	
And my heart breaks at it.	
LEAR	
Read.	
GLOUCESTER	
What, with the case of eyes?	
LEAR	
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head,	
nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy	
case, your purse in a light; yet you see how this world	
goes.	
GLOUCESTER	
I see it feelingly.	
LEAR	
What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes	
with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yon justice	
rails upon yon simple thief. Hark in thine ear – change	
places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is	
the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a	
beggar?	
GLOUCESTER	
Ay, sir.	
LEAR	
And the creature run from the cur? There thou	
mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog's	
obeyed in office.	
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand.	
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back.	
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind	
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.	
Thorough tattered clothes great vices do appear;	
Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sins with gold,	
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;	
Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.	
None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em.	
Take that of me, my friend, (giving flowers) who have the power	
To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes,	
And like a scurvy politician seem	
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!	
Pull off my boots. Harder, harder – so.	
EDGAR	
O matter and impertinency mixed,	
Reason in madness!	
LEAR	
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.	
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.	
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither.	
Thou knowest the first time that we smell the air	
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee – Mark!	
He takes off his coronet of flowers	
GLOUCESTER	
Alack, alack the day!	
LEAR	
When we are born we cry that we are come	
To this great stage of fools. – This's a good block.	
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe	
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put 't in proof;	
And when I have stolen upon these son-in-laws,	
Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	
He throws down his flowers and stamps on them	
Enter a Gentleman and two attendants. Gloucester	
and Edgar draw back	
GENTLEMAN	
O, here he is. Lay hand upon him. – Sir,	
Your most dear daughter –	
LEAR	
No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even	
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;	
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;	
I am cut to the brains.	
GENTLEMAN	
You shall have anything.	
LEAR	
No seconds? All myself?	
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,	
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,	
Ay, and laying autumn's dust. I will die bravely,	
Like a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial.	
Come, come, I am a king; masters, know you that?	
GENTLEMAN	
You are a royal one, and we obey you.	
LEAR	
Then there's life in't. Nay, and you get it you shall	
get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.	
Exit running, followed by attendants	
GENTLEMAN	
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,	
Past speaking of in a king. – Thou hast one daughter	
Who redeems nature from the general curse	
Which twain have brought her to.	
EDGAR	
(coming forward)	
Hail, gentle sir.	
GENTLEMAN	
Sir, speed you; what's your will?	
EDGAR	
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?	
GENTLEMAN	
Most sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that	
Which can distinguish sound.	
EDGAR	
But, by your favour,	
How near's the other army?	
GENTLEMAN	
Near, and on speedy foot. The main descry	
Stands on the hourly thought.	
EDGAR	
I thank you, sir; that's all.	
GENTLEMAN	
Though that the Queen on special cause is here,	
Her army is moved on.	
EDGAR	
I thank you, sir.	
Exit Gentleman	
GLOUCESTER	
(coming forward)	
You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me.	
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again	
To die before you please.	
EDGAR	
Well pray you, father.	
GLOUCESTER	
Now, good sir, what are you?	
EDGAR	
A most poor man made tame to fortune's blows,	
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,	
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,	
I'll lead you to some biding.	
GLOUCESTER	
Hearty thanks;	
The bounty and the benison of heaven	
To boot, and boot!	
Enter Oswald	
OSWALD	
A proclaimed prize! Most happy!	
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh	
To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,	
Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out	
That must destroy thee.	
GLOUCESTER	
Now let thy friendly hand	
Put strength enough to't.	
Edgar intervenes	
OSWALD	
Wherefore, bold peasant,	
Darest thou support a published traitor? Hence,	
Lest that th' infection of his fortune take	
Like hold on thee. Let go his arm!	
EDGAR	
Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.	
OSWALD	
Let go, slave, or thou diest!	
EDGAR	
Good gentleman, go your gait and let poor volk	
pass. And 'choud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,	
'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight. Nay,	
come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor' ye, or I'ce	
try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder.	
'Chill be plain with you.	
OSWALD	
Out, dunghill!	
EDGAR	
'Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come; no matter vor	
your foins.	
They fight	
OSWALD	
Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.	
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body	
And give the letters which thou find'st about me	
To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out	
Upon the English party. O, untimely	
Death! – Death –	
He dies	
EDGAR	
I know thee well: a serviceable villain,	
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress	
As badness would desire.	
GLOUCESTER	
What, is he dead?	
EDGAR	
Sit you down, father; rest you. –	
Let's see these pockets. The letters that he speaks of	
May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry	
He had no other deathsman. Let us see.	
Leave, gentle wax; and manners blame us not;	
To know our enemies' minds we rip their hearts;	
Their papers is more lawful.	
(He reads the letter)	
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many	
opportunities to cut him off; if your will want not, time and	
place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he	
return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed	
my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and	
supply the place for your labour.	
Your – wife, so I would say – affectionate servant,	
Gonerill.	
O indistinguished space of woman's will!	
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,	
And the exchange, my brother! Here in the sands	
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified	
Of murderous lechers; and in the mature time	
With this ungracious paper strike the sight	
Of the death-practised Duke. For him 'tis well	
That of thy death and business I can tell.	
GLOUCESTER	
The King is mad; how stiff is my vile sense,	
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling	
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract;	
So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs,	
And woes by wrong imaginations lose	
The knowledge of themselves.	
Drum afar off	
EDGAR	
Give me your hand.	
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.	
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.	
Exeunt	
Act 4, scene 7
Enter Cordelia, Kent, and Doctor	
CORDELIA	
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work	
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short	
And every measure fail me.	
KENT	
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.	
All my reports go with the modest truth,	
Nor more nor clipped, but so.	
CORDELIA	
Be better suited.	
These weeds are memories of those worser hours.	
I prithee put them off.	
KENT	
Pardon, dear madam,	
Yet to be known shortens my made intent.	
My boon I make it that you know me not	
Till time and I think meet.	
CORDELIA	
Then be't so, my good lord.	
(To Doctor)	
How does the King?	
DOCTOR	
Madam, sleeps still.	
CORDELIA	
O you kind gods,	
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!	
Th' untuned and jarring senses O wind up	
Of this child-changed father!	
DOCTOR	
So please your majesty,	
That we may wake the King. He hath slept long.	
CORDELIA	
Be governed by your knowledge and proceed	
I'the sway of your own will. Is he arrayed?	
GENTLEMAN	
Ay, madam; in the heaviness of sleep	
We put fresh garments on him.	
Enter Gentleman ushering Lear in a chair carried by	
servants. All fall to their knees	
DOCTOR	
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;	
I doubt not of his temperance.	
CORDELIA	
Very well.	
Music sounds off stage	
DOCTOR	
Please you draw near. – Louder the music there!	
CORDELIA	
(kneeling by the chair and kissing his hand)	
O my dear father! Restoration hang	
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss	
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters	
Have in thy reverence made.	
KENT	
Kind and dear princess!	
CORDELIA	
Had you not been their father, these white flakes	
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face	
To be opposed against the jarring winds?	
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder,	
In the most terrible and nimble stroke	
Of quick cross lightning? To watch, poor perdu,	
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,	
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night	
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,	
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn	
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!	
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once	
Had not concluded all. – He wakes! Speak to him.	
DOCTOR	
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.	
CORDELIA	
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?	
LEAR	
You do me wrong to take me out o'the grave.	
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound	
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears	
Do scald like molten lead.	
CORDELIA	
Sir, do you know me?	
LEAR	
You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?	
CORDELIA	
Still, still, far wide!	
DOCTOR	
He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.	
LEAR	
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?	
I am mightily abused. I should even die with pity	
To see another thus. I know not what to say.	
I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.	
I feel this pin-prick. Would I were assured	
Of my condition!	
CORDELIA	
O look upon me, sir,	
And hold your hand in benediction o'er me.	
(Lear falls to his knees)	
No, sir, you must not kneel.	
LEAR	
Pray do not mock me.	
I am a very foolish fond old man,	
Four score and upward, not an hour more nor less,	
And, to deal plainly,	
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.	
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;	
Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant	
What place this is; and all the skill I have	
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not	
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,	
For, as I am a man, I think this lady	
To be my child Cordelia.	
CORDELIA	
(weeping)	
And so I am, I am.	
LEAR	
Be your tears wet? Yes, faith! I pray, weep not.	
If you have poison for me I will drink it.	
I know you do not love me, for your sisters	
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.	
You have some cause; they have not.	
CORDELIA	
No cause, no cause.	
LEAR	
Am I in France?	
KENT	
In your own kingdom, sir.	
LEAR	
Do not abuse me.	
DOCTOR	
Be comforted, good madam. The great rage,	
You see, is killed in him; and yet it is danger	
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.	
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more	
Till further settling.	
CORDELIA	
Will't please your highness walk?	
LEAR	
You must bear with me. Pray you now, forget and	
forgive. I am old and foolish.	
Exeunt all but Kent and Gentleman	
GENTLEMAN	
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall	
was so slain?	
KENT	
Most certain, sir.	
GENTLEMAN	
Who is conductor of his people?	
KENT	
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.	
GENTLEMAN	
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with	
the Earl of Kent in Germany.	
KENT	
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about. The	
powers of the kingdom approach apace.	
GENTLEMAN	
The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare	
you well, sir.	
Exit	
KENT	
My point and period will be throughly wrought,	
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.	
Exit	
Act 5, scene 1
Enter, with drum and colours, Edmund, Regan,	
gentlemen, and soldiers.	
EDMUND	
(to a gentleman)	
Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold	
Or whether since he is advised by aught	
To change the course. (To Regan) He's full of alteration	
And self-reproving. (To gentleman) Bring his constant pleasure.	
Exit gentleman	
REGAN	
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.	
EDMUND	
'Tis to be doubted, madam.	
REGAN	
Now, sweet lord,	
You know the goodness I intend upon you.	
Tell me but truly – but then speak the truth –	
Do you not love my sister?	
EDMUND	
In honoured love.	
REGAN	
But have you never found my brother's way	
To the forfended place?	
EDMUND	
That thought abuses you.	
REGAN	
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct	
And bosomed with her, as far as we call hers.	
EDMUND	
No, by mine honour, madam.	
REGAN	
I never shall endure her; dear my lord,	
Be not familiar with her.	
EDMUND	
Fear not.	
She and the Duke her husband!	
Enter, with drum and colours, Albany, Gonerill, and	
soldiers	
GONERILL	
(aside)	
I had rather lose the battle than that sister	
Should loosen him and me.	
ALBANY	
Our very loving sister, well be-met.	
Sir, this I heard; the King is come to his daughter,	
With others whom the rigour of our state	
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,	
I never yet was valiant. For this business,	
It touches us as France invades our land,	
Not bolds the King, with others – whom, I fear,	
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.	
EDMUND	
Sir, you speak nobly.	
REGAN	
Why is this reasoned?	
GONERILL	
Combine together 'gainst the enemy.	
For these domestic and particular broils	
Are not the question here.	
ALBANY	
Let's then determine	
With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.	
EDMUND	
I shall attend you presently at your tent.	
REGAN	
Sister, you'll go with us?	
GONERILL	
No.	
REGAN	
'Tis most convenient. Pray go with us.	
GONERILL	
(aside)	
O, ho, I know the riddle. (Aloud) I will go.	
Exeunt both the armies	
As Albany is going out, enter Edgar	
EDGAR	
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,	
Hear me one word.	
ALBANY	
(to his captains)	
I'll overtake you.	
(To Edgar)	
Speak.	
EDGAR	
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.	
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound	
For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,	
I can produce a champion that will prove	
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,	
Your business of the world hath so an end,	
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.	
ALBANY	
Stay till I have read the letter.	
EDGAR	
I was forbid it.	
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry	
And I'll appear again.	
Exit	
ALBANY	
Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.	
Enter Edmund	
EDMUND	
The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.	
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces	
By diligent discovery; but your haste	
Is now urged on you.	
ALBANY	
We will greet the time.	
Exit	
EDMUND	
To both these sisters have I sworn my love;	
Each jealous of the other as the stung	
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?	
Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed	
If both remain alive. To take the widow	
Exasperates, makes mad, her sister Gonerill,	
And hardly shall I carry out my side,	
Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use	
His countenance for the battle, which being done,	
Let her who would be rid of him devise	
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy	
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,	
The battle done and they within our power,	
Shall never see his pardon; for my state	
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.

Exit Edgar	
Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar	
EDGAR	
Away, old man! Give me thy hand; away!	
King Lear hath lost; he and his daughter ta'en.	
Give me thy hand; come on.	
GLOUCESTER	
No further, sir; a man may rot even here.	
EDGAR	
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure	
Their going hence even as their coming hither;	
Ripeness is all. Come on.	
GLOUCESTER	
And that's true too.	
Exeunt	
Act 5, scene 3
Enter in conquest with drum and colours Edmund;	
Lear and Cordelia as prisoners; soldiers, Captain	
EDMUND	
Some officers take them away. Good guard,	
Until their greater pleasures first be known	
That are to censure them.	
CORDELIA	
We are not the first	
Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.	
For thee, oppressed King, I am cast down;	
Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.	
(To Edmund)	
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?	
LEAR	
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.	
We two alone will sing like birds i'the cage;	
When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down	
And ask of thee forgiveness; so we'll live,	
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh	
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues	
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too –	
Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out –	
And take upon's the mystery of things	
As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,	
In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones	
That ebb and flow by the moon.	
EDMUND	
Take them away.	
LEAR	
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,	
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?	
(He embraces her)	
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven	
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;	
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,	
Ere they shall make us weep. We'll see 'em starved first.	
Come.	
Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded	
EDMUND	
Come hither, captain. Hark.	
Take thou this note; go follow them to prison.	
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost	
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way	
To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men	
Are as the time is; to be tender-minded	
Does not become a sword; thy great employment	
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do't,	
Or thrive by other means.	
CAPTAIN	
I'll do't, my lord.	
EDMUND	
About it; and write happy when th' hast done.	
Mark, I say ‘ instantly;’ and carry it so	
As I have set it down.	
CAPTAIN	
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats;	
If it be man's work, I'll do't.	
Exit	
Flourish. Enter Albany, Gonerill, Regan, and	
officers	
ALBANY	
Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain,	
And Fortune led you well. You have the captives	
That were the opposites of this day's strife;	
I do require them of you, so to use them	
As we shall find their merits and our safety	
May equally determine.	
EDMUND	
Sir, I thought it fit	
To send the old and miserable King	
To some retention and appointed guard;	
Whose age had charms in it, whose title more,	
To pluck the common bosom on his side	
And turn our impressed lances in our eyes	
Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,	
My reason all the same; and they are ready	
Tomorrow or at further space t' appear	
Where you shall hold your session. At this time	
We sweat and bleed; the friend hath lost his friend,	
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed	
By those that feel their sharpness.	
The question of Cordelia and her father	
Requires a fitter place.	
ALBANY	
Sir, by your patience,	
I hold you but a subject of this war,	
Not as a brother.	
REGAN	
That's as we list to grace him.	
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded	
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,	
Bore the commission of my place and person,	
The which immediacy may well stand up	
And call itself your brother.	
GONERILL	
Not so hot!	
In his own grace he doth exalt himself	
More than in your addition.	
REGAN	
In my rights,	
By me invested, he compeers the best.	
GONERILL	
That were the most if he should husband you.	
REGAN	
Jesters do oft prove prophets.	
GONERILL	
Holla, holla!	
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.	
REGAN	
Lady, I am not well; else I should answer	
From a full-flowing stomach. (To Edmund) General,	
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony,	
Dispose of them, of me; the walls is thine.	
Witness the world that I create thee here	
My lord and master.	
GONERILL	
Mean you to enjoy him?	
ALBANY	
The let-alone lies not in your good will.	
EDMUND	
Nor in thine, lord.	
ALBANY	
Half-blooded fellow, yes.	
REGAN	
(to Edmund)	
Let the drum strike and prove my title thine.	
ALBANY	
Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee	
On capital treason, and, in thy attaint,	
(he points to Gonerill)	
This gilded serpent. For your claim, fair sister,	
I bar it in the interest of my wife.	
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,	
And I her husband contradict your banns.	
If you will marry, make your loves to me;	
My lady is bespoke.	
GONERILL	
An interlude!	
ALBANY	
Thou art armed, Gloucester; let the trumpet sound.	
If none appear to prove upon thy person	
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,	
There is my pledge.	
He throws down his glove	
I'll make it on thy heart,	
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less	
Than I have here proclaimed thee.	
REGAN	
Sick, O sick!	
GONERILL	
(aside)	
If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.	
EDMUND	
(throwing down his glove)	
There's my exchange. What in the world he is	
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.	
Call by the trumpet. He that dares approach,	
On him, on you – who not? – I will maintain	
My truth and honour firmly.	
ALBANY	
A herald, ho!	
Enter a Herald	
Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,	
All levied in my name, have in my name	
Took their discharge.	
REGAN	
My sickness grows upon me.	
ALBANY	
She is not well. Convey her to my tent.	
Exit Regan, supported	
Come hither, herald; let the trumpet sound,	
And read out this.	
A trumpet sounds	
HERALD	
(reading)	
If any man of quality or degree within the	
lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed	
Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him	
appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his	
defence.	
(First trumpet)	
Again!	
(Second trumpet)	
Again!	
(Third trumpet)	
Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar armed, a	
trumpet before him	
ALBANY	
Ask him his purposes, why he appears	
Upon this call o'the trumpet.	
HERALD	
What are you?	
Your name, your quality, and why you answer	
This present summons?	
EDGAR	
Know, my name is lost,	
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit;	
Yet am I noble as the adversary	
I come to cope.	
ALBANY	
Which is that adversary?	
EDGAR	
What's he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?	
EDMUND	
Himself. What sayest thou to him?	
EDGAR	
Draw thy sword,	
That if my speech offend a noble heart	
Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.	
He draws his sword	
Behold; it is the privilege of mine honours,	
My oath, and my profession. I protest,	
Maugre thy strength, place, youth, and eminence,	
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,	
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,	
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,	
Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince,	
And, from th' extremest upward of thy head	
To the descent and dust below thy foot,	
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou ‘ no,’	
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent	
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,	
Thou liest.	
EDMUND	
In wisdom I should ask thy name;	
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike	
And that thy tongue some 'say of breeding breathes,	
What safe and nicely I might well delay	
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.	
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,	
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart,	
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,	
This sword of mine shall give them instant way	
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!	
Alarums. Fights. Edmund falls	
ALBANY	
(to Edgar, about to kill Edmund)	
Save him, save him!	
GONERILL	
This is practice, Gloucester:	
By the law of war thou wast not bound to answer	
An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquished,	
But cozened and beguiled.	
ALBANY	
Shut your mouth, dame,	
Or with this paper shall I stop it – Hold, sir!	
(To Gonerill)	
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.	
No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.	
GONERILL	
Say if I do; the laws are mine, not thine.	
Who can arraign me for't?	
ALBANY	
Most monstrous! O!	
(To Edmund)	
Knowest thou this paper?	
EDMUND	
Ask me not what I know.	
Exit Gonerill	
ALBANY	
Go after her. She's desperate. Govern her.	
Exit First Officer	
EDMUND	
What you have charged me with, that have I done,	
And more, much more; the time will bring it out.	
'Tis past; and so am I. But what art thou	
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,	
I do forgive thee.	
EDGAR	
Let's exchange charity.	
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;	
If more, the more th' hast wronged me.	
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.	
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices	
Make instruments to plague us:	
The dark and vicious place where thee he got	
Cost him his eyes.	
EDMUND	
Th' hast spoken right. 'Tis true;	
The wheel is come full circle; I am here.	
ALBANY	
Methought thy very gait did prophesy	
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.	
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I	
Did hate thee or thy father.	
EDGAR	
Worthy prince,	
I know't.	
ALBANY	
Where have you hid yourself?	
How have you known the miseries of your father?	
EDGAR	
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;	
And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!	
The bloody proclamation to escape	
That followed me so near – O, our life's sweetness,	
That we the pain of death would hourly die	
Rather than die at once – taught me to shift	
Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance	
That very dogs disdained; and in this habit	
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,	
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,	
Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair,	
Never – O fault! – revealed myself unto him	
Until some half-hour past, when I was armed,	
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,	
I asked his blessing, and from first to last	
Told him my pilgrimage; but his flawed heart –	
Alack, too weak the conflict to support –	
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,	
Burst smilingly.	
EDMUND	
This speech of yours hath moved me,	
And shall perchance do good. But speak you on;	
You look as you had something more to say.	
ALBANY	
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;	
For I am almost ready to dissolve,	
Hearing of this.	
EDGAR	
This would have seemed a period	
To such as love not sorrow; but another	
To amplify too much would make much more	
And top extremity.	
Whilst I was big in clamour, came there in a man,	
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,	
Shunned my abhorred society; but then finding	
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms	
He fastened on my neck and bellowed out	
As he'd burst heaven, threw him on my father,	
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him	
That ever ear received; which in recounting	
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life	
Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,	
And there I left him tranced.	
ALBANY	
But who was this?	
EDGAR	
Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who, in disguise,	
Followed his enemy king and did him service	
Improper for a slave.	
Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife	
GENTLEMAN	
Help, help! O, help!	
EDGAR	
What kind of help?	
ALBANY	
Speak, man.	
EDGAR	
What means this bloody knife?	
GENTLEMAN	
'Tis hot; it smokes!	
It came even from the heart of – O, she's dead!	
ALBANY	
Who dead? Speak, man.	
GENTLEMAN	
Your lady, sir; your lady! And her sister	
By her is poisoned; she confesses it.	
EDMUND	
I was contracted to them both. All three	
Now marry in an instant.	
EDGAR	
Here comes Kent.	
Enter Kent	
ALBANY	
Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.	
Exit Gentleman	
This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble	
Touches us not with pity. (To Kent) O, is this he?	
The time will not allow the compliment	
Which very manners urges.	
KENT	
I am come	
To bid my King and master aye good night:.	
Is he not here?	
ALBANY	
Great thing of us forgot.	
Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?	
Gonerill's and Regan's bodies are brought out	
See'st thou this object, Kent?	
KENT	
Alack, why thus?	
EDMUND	
Yet Edmund was beloved.	
The one the other poisoned for my sake	
And after slew herself.	
ALBANY	
Even so. Cover their faces.	
EDMUND	
I pant for life; some good I mean to do	
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send –	
Be brief in it – to the castle, for my writ	
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.	
Nay, send in time!	
ALBANY	
Run, run, O run!	
EDGAR	
To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send	
Thy token of reprieve.	
EDMUND	
Well thought on. (To Second Officer) Take my sword,	
Give it the captain.	
ALBANY	
Haste thee for thy life.	
Exit Second Officer	
EDMUND	
He hath commission from thy wife and me	
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and	
To lay the blame upon her own despair,	
That she fordid herself.	
ALBANY	
The gods defend her. Bear him hence awhile.	
Edmund is borne off	
Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms, followed by	
Second Officer and others –	
LEAR	
Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!	
Had I your tongues and eyes I'd use them so	
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever.	
I know when one is dead and when one lives;	
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;	
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,	
Why, then she lives.	
KENT	
Is this the promised end?	
EDGAR	
Or image of that horror?	
ALBANY	
Fall and cease!	
LEAR	
This feather stirs – she lives! If it be so,	
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows	
That ever I have felt.	
KENT	
O my good master!	
LEAR	
Prithee away.	
EDGAR	
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.	
LEAR	
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!	
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever.	
Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!	
What is't thou sayest? Her voice was ever soft,	
Gentle and low – an excellent thing in woman.	
I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.	
SECOND OFFICER	
'Tis true, my lords; he did.	
LEAR	
Did I not, fellow?	
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion	
I would have made him skip. I am old now	
And these same crosses spoil me. – Who are you?	
Mine eyes are not o'the best, I'll tell you straight.	
KENT	
If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated	
One of them we behold.	
LEAR	
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?	
KENT	
The same –	
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?	
LEAR	
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;	
He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.	
KENT	
No, my good lord; I am the very man –	
LEAR	
I'll see that straight.	
KENT	
That from your first of difference and decay,	
Have followed your sad steps –	
LEAR	
You are welcome hither.	
KENT	
Nor no man else. All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.	
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,	
And desperately are dead.	
LEAR	
Ay, so I think.	
ALBANY	
He knows not what he sees, and vain is it	
That we present us to him.	
EDGAR	
Very bootless.	
Enter a Messenger	
MESSENGER	
Edmund is dead, my lord.	
ALBANY	
That's but a trifle here.	
You lords and noble friends, know our intent:	
What comfort to this great decay may come	
Shall be applied. For us we will resign	
During the life of this old majesty	
To him our absolute power.	
(To Edgar and Kent)	
You, to your rights	
With boot, and such addition as your honours	
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste	
The wages of their virtue, and all foes	
The cup of their deservings. – O, see, see!	
LEAR	
And my poor fool is hanged! No, no, no life!	
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,	
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more;	
Never, never, never, never, never.	
Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.	
Do you see this? Look on her! Look, her lips!,	
Look there! Look there!	
He dies	
EDGAR	
He faints. My lord, my lord!	
KENT	
Break, heart; I prithee break.	
EDGAR	
Look up, my lord.	
KENT	
Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass. He hates him	
That would upon the rack of this tough world	
Stretch him out longer.	
EDGAR	
He is gone indeed.	
KENT	
The wonder is he hath endured so long.	
He but usurped his life.	
ALBANY	
Bear them from hence. Our present business	
Is general woe.	
(To Kent and Edgar)	
Friends of my soul, you twain,	
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.	
KENT	
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.	
My master calls me, I must not say no.	
ALBANY	
The weight of this sad time we must obey;	
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.	
The oldest hath borne most; we that are young	
Shall never see so much nor live so long.	
Exeunt with a dead march
