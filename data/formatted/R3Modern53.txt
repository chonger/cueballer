NS: Act 5 Scene 3

SD: Enter King +RICHARD in arms, with +NORFOLK, +RATCLIFFE, and the Earl of +SURREY, and soldiers

+RICHARD
Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

+SURREY
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

+RICHARD
My Lord of Norfolk –

+NORFOLK
Here, most gracious liege.

+RICHARD
Norfolk, we must have knocks. Ha! Must we not?

+NORFOLK
We must both give and take, my loving lord.

+RICHARD
Up with my tent! Here will I lie tonight.

SD: Soldiers begin to set up the King's tent

But where tomorrow? Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?

+NORFOLK
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

+RICHARD
Why, our battalia trebles that account;
Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse faction want.
Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
Call for some men of sound direction.
Let's lack no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.

SD: Exeunt +RICHARD, +NORFOLK, +RATCLIFFE, +SURREY. Enter +RICHMOND, Sir William Brandon, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, and +BLUNT. Some of the soldiers pitch Richmond's tent

+RICHMOND
The weary sun hath made a golden set
And by the bright track of his fiery car
Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
Give me some ink and paper in my tent:
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small power.
My Lord of Oxford – you, Sir William Brandon –
And you, Sir Walter Herbert – stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And by the second hour in the morning
Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me –
Where is Lord Stanley quartered, do you know?

+BLUNT
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the King.

+RICHMOND
If without peril it be possible,
Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him
And give him from me this most needful note.

+BLUNT
Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
And so God give you quiet rest tonight!

+RICHMOND
Good night, good Captain Blunt.

SD: +BLUNT exits

+RICHMOND
Come, gentlemen,
Let us consult upon tomorrow's business.
Into my tent; the dew is raw and cold.

SD: +RICHMOND, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, withdraw into the tent. Enter, to his tent, +RICHARD, +RATCLIFFE, +NORFOLK, and +CATESBY.

+RICHARD
What is't a clock?

+CATESBY
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine a clock.

+RICHARD
I will not sup tonight.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

+CATESBY
It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

+RICHARD
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

+NORFOLK
I go, my lord.

+RICHARD
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.

+NORFOLK
I warrant you, my lord.

SD: +NORFOLK exits

+RICHARD
Catesby!

+CATESBY
My lord?

+RICHARD
Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.

SD: +CATESBY exits

+RICHARD
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.
Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy.
Ratcliffe!

+RATCLIFFE
My lord?

+RICHARD
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

+RATCLIFFE
Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
Much about cockshut-time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

+RICHARD
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
I have not that alacrity of spirit
Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.

SD: A bowl of wine is brought

+RICHARD
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

+RATCLIFFE
It is, my lord.

+RICHARD
Bid my guard watch. Leave me. Ratcliffe,
About the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

SD: +RATCLIFFE exits with others. +RICHARD withdraws into his tent, and sleeps. Enter Earl of DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent, lords and others attending

+DERBY
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

+RICHMOND
All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

+DERBY
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
So much for that. The silent hours steal on
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief, for so the season bids us be,
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
And put thy fortune to th' arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may – that which I would I cannot –
With best advantage will deceive the time
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.
But on thy side I may not be too forward,
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell. The leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon.
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more adieu. Be valiant, and speed well!

+RICHMOND
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow,
When I should mount with wings of victory.
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.

SD: Exeunt +DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT. +RICHMOND remains

+RICHMOND
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
Th' usurping helmets of our adversaries;
Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may praise Thee in the victory.
To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
Sleeping and waking, O defend me still!

SD: +RICHMOND Sleeps. Enter +GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD SON OF HENRY VI

+GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD SON OF HENRY VI
[To Richard]
Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!
Think how thou stab'st me in my prime of youth
At Tewkesbury; despair therefore, and die!
[To Richmond]
Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged souls
Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf
King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.

SD: +GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD SON OF HENRY VI exits. Enter the +GHOST OF HENRY VI

+GHOST OF HENRY VI
[to Richard]
When I was mortal, my anointed body
By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
Think on the Tower, and me; despair, and die!
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die!
[To Richmond] Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,
Doth comfort thee in thy sleep; live, and flourish!

SD: +GHOST OF HENRY VI exits. Enter the +GHOST OF CLARENCE

+GHOST OF CLARENCE
[to Richard]
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow –
I that was washed to death with fulsome wine,
Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
And fall thy edgeless sword; despair, and die!
[To Richmond] Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee;
Good angels guard thy battle! Live, and flourish!

SD: Exit +GHOST OF CLARENCE. Enter the +GHOST OF RIVERS, +GHOST OF GREY, +GHOST OF VAUGHAN

+GHOST OF RIVERS
[to Richard]
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow,
Rivers, that died at Pomfret; despair, and die!

+GHOST OF GREY
Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!

+GHOST OF VAUGHAN
Think upon Vaughan and with guilty fear
Let fall thy lance; despair, and die!

+GHOST OF RIVERS, +GHOST OF GREY, +GHOST OF VAUGHAN
[to Richmond]
Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom
Will conquer him! Awake, and win the day!

SD: Exit +GHOST OF RIVERS, +GHOST OF GREY, +GHOST OF VAUGHAN. Enter +GHOST OF HASTINGS.

+GHOST OF HASTINGS
[to Richard]
Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake
And in a bloody battle end thy days!
Think on Lord Hastings; despair, and die!
[To Richmond] Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!

SD: +GHOST OF HASTINGS exits. Enter +GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD, +GHOST OF YORK

+GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD, +GHOST OF YORK
[to Richard]
Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair, and die!
[To Richmond]
Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

SD: +GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD, +GHOST OF YORK exit. Enter the +GHOST OF ANNE, his wife

+GHOST OF ANNE
[to Richard]
Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
And fall thy edgeless sword; despair, and die!
[To Richmond] Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep.
Dream of success and happy victory!
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

SD: +GHOST OF ANNE exits. Enter the +GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM

+GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM
[to Richard]
The first was I that helped thee to the crown;
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
[To Richmond] I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid,
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed;
God and good angels fight on Richmond's side,
And Richard falls in height of all his pride!

SD: +GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM exits. +RICHARD starts out of his dream

+RICHARD
Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!
Have mercy, Jesu! – Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
Richard loves Richard: that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why –
Lest I revenge. Myself upon myself?
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O no! Alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself.
I am a villain. Yet I lie, I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree.
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree,
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, ‘ Guilty! Guilty!’
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul will pity me.
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murdered
Came to my tent, and every one did threat
Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

SD: Enter +RATCLIFFE

+RATCLIFFE
My lord!

+RICHARD
Zounds, who is there?

+RATCLIFFE
Ratcliffe, my lord, 'tis I. The early village cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.

+RICHARD
O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou? Will our friends prove all true?

+RATCLIFFE
No doubt, my lord.

+RICHARD
Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear!

+RATCLIFFE
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

+RICHARD
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me.
Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.

SD: Exeunt +RICHARD and +RATCLIFFE

SD: Enter the Lords to Richmond {+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT} sitting in his tent

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
Good morrow, Richmond!

+RICHMOND
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
How have you slept, my lord?

+RICHMOND
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever entered in a drowsy head
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered
Came to my tent and cried on victory.
I promise you my heart is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
Upon the stroke of four.

+RICHMOND
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
[His oration to his soldiers]
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this:
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow.
For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood and one in blood established;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy.
Then if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quits it in your age.
Then in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully:
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

SD: Exeunt +RICHMOND, +DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT.Enter +RICHARD, +RATCLIFFE, and soldiers

+RICHARD
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

+RATCLIFFE
That he was never trained up in arms.

+RICHARD
He said the truth. And what said Surrey then?

+RATCLIFFE
He smiled and said, ‘ The better for our purpose.’

+RICHARD
He was in the right, and so indeed it is.

SD: Clock strikes

Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun today?

+RATCLIFFE
Not I, my lord.

+RICHARD
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago.
A black day will it be to somebody.
Ratcliffe!

+RATCLIFFE
My lord?

+RICHARD
The sun will not be seen today;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine today? Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

SD: Enter +NORFOLK

+NORFOLK
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

+RICHARD
Come, bustle, bustle! Caparison my horse!
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst;
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

+NORFOLK
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
This found I on my tent this morning.

SD: +NORFOLK showeth him a paper

+RICHARD
[reads]
*‘ Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.’*
A thing devised by the enemy.
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge.
[Aside] Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law!
[To them] March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell,
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
[His oration to his army]
What shall I say more than I have inferred?
Remember whom you are to cope withal –
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britains and base lackey peasants,
Whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
To desperate adventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
You having lands, and blessed with beauteous wives,
They would distrain the one, distain the other.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
Long kept in Britain at our mother's cost?
A milksop, one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again,
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
These famished beggars, weary of their lives,
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves.
If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
And not these bastard Britains, whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped,
And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters? 

SD: Drum afar off

Hark! I hear their drum.
Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood!
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!

SD: Enter +FIRST MESSENGER

+RICHARD
What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?

+FIRST MESSENGER
My lord, he doth deny to come.

+RICHARD
Off with his son George's head!

+NORFOLK
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.
After the battle let George Stanley die.

+RICHARD
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom!
Advance our standards, set upon our foes.
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.

SD: Exeunt +RICHARD, +NORFOLK, +RATCLIFFE, +FIRST MESSENGER
