SD: Enter King +RICHARD in Armes with +NORFOLKE, +RATCLIFFE, and the Earle of +SURREY.

+RICHARD
Here pitch our Tent, euen here in Bosworth field,
My Lord of Surrey, why looke you so sad?

+SURREY
My heart is ten times lighter then my lookes.

+RICHARD
My Lord of Norfolke.

+NORFOLKE
Heere most gracious Liege.

+RICHARD
Norfolke, we must haue knockes: / Ha, must we not?

+NORFOLKE
We must both giue and take my louing Lord.

+RICHARD
Vp with my Tent, heere wil I lye to night,
But where to morrow? Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the Traitors?

+NORFOLKE
Six or seuen thousand is their vtmost power.

+RICHARD
Why our Battalia trebbles that account:
Besides, the Kings name is a Tower of strength,
Which they vpon the aduerse Faction want.
Vp with the Tent: Come Noble Gentlemen,
Let vs suruey the vantage of the ground.
Call for some men of sound direction:
Let's lacke no Discipline, make no delay,
For Lords, to morrow is a busie day.

SD: Exeunt +RICHARD, +NORFOLKE, +RATCLIFFE, +SURREY. Enter +RICHMOND, Sir William Brandon, +BLUNT, +OXFORD, and +DORSET.

+RICHMOND
The weary Sunne, hath made a Golden set,
And by the bright Tract of his fiery Carre,
Giues token of a goodly day to morrow.
Sir William Brandon, you shall beare my Standard:
Giue me some Inke and Paper in my Tent:
Ile draw the Forme and Modell of our Battaile,
Limit each Leader to his seuerall Charge,
And part in iust proportion our small Power.
My Lord of Oxford, you Sir William Brandon,
And your Sir Walter Herbert stay with me:
The Earle of Pembroke keepes his Regiment;
Good Captaine Blunt, beare my goodnight to him,
And by the second houre in the Morning,
Desire the Earle to see me in my Tent:
Yet one thing more (good Captaine) do for me:	
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?

+BLUNT
Vnlesse I haue mistane his Colours much,
(Which well I am assur'd I haue not done)	
His Regiment lies halfe a Mile at least
South, from the mighty Power of the King.

+RICHMOND
If without perill it be possible,
Sweet Blunt, make some good meanes to speak with him
And giue him from me, this most needfull Note.

+BLUNT
Vpon my life, my Lord, Ile vndertake it,
And so God giue you quiet rest to night.

+RICHMOND
Good night good Captaine Blunt:
Come Gentlemen,
Let vs consult vpon to morrowes Businesse;
Into my Tent, the Dew is rawe and cold.

SD: +RICHMOND, +BLUNT, +OXFORD, and +DORSET withdraw into the Tent. Enter +RICHARD, +RATCLIFFE, +NORFOLKE, & +CATESBY.

+RICHARD
What is't a Clocke?

+CATESBY
It's Supper time my Lord,
it's nine a clocke.

+RICHARD
I will not sup to night,
Giue me some Inke and Paper:
What, is my Beauer easier then it was?
And all my Armour laid into my Tent?

+CATESBY
It is my Liege: and all things are in readinesse.

+RICHARD
Good Norfolke, hye thee to thy charge,
Vse carefull Watch, choose trusty Centinels,

+NORFOLKE
I go my Lord.

+RICHARD
Stir with the Larke to morrow, gentle Norfolk.

+NORFOLKE
I warrant you my Lord.

SD: +NORFOLKE exits

+RICHARD
Ratcliffe.

+RATCLIFFE
My Lord.

+RICHARD
Send out a Pursuiuant at Armes
To Stanleys Regiment: bid him bring his power
Before Sun-rising, least his Sonne George fall
Into the blinde Caue of eternall night.
Fill me a Bowle of Wine: Giue me a Watch,
Saddle white Surrey for the Field to morrow:
Look that my Staues be sound, & not too heauy.
Ratcliff.

+RATCLIFFE
My Lord.

+RICHARD
Saw'st the melancholly Lord Northumberland?

+RATCLIFFE
Thomas the Earle of Surrey, and himselfe,
Much about Cockshut time, from Troope to Troope
Went through the Army, chearing vp the Souldiers.

+RICHARD
So, I am satisfied: Giue me a Bowle of Wine,
I haue not that Alacrity of Spirit,
Nor cheere of Minde that I was wont to haue.
Set it downe. Is Inke and Paper ready?

+RATCLIFFE
It is my Lord.

+RICHARD
Bid my Guard watch. Leaue me. / Ratcliffe,
about the mid of night come to my Tent
And helpe to arme me. Leaue me I say.

SD: +RATCLIFFE exits. SD: Enter +DERBY to +RICHMOND in his Tent.

+DERBY
Fortune, and Victory sit on thy Helme.

+RICHMOND
All comfort that the darke night can affoord,
Be to thy Person, Noble Father in Law.
Tell me, how fares our Noble Mother?

+DERBY
I by Attourney, blesse thee from thy Mother,
Who prayes continually for Richmonds good:
So much for that. The silent houres steale on,
And flakie darkenesse breakes within the East.
In breefe, for so the season bids vs be,
Prepare thy Battell early in the Morning,
And put thy Fortune to th' Arbitrement
Of bloody stroakes, and mortall staring Warre:
I, as I may, that which I would, I cannot,
With best aduantage will deceiue thet ime,
And ayde thee in this doubtfull shocke of Armes.
But on thy side I may not be too forward,
Least being seene, thy Brother, tender George
Be executed in his Fathers sight.
Farewell: the leysure, and the fearfull time
Cuts off the ceremonious Vowes of Loue,
And ample enterchange of sweet Discourse,
Which so long sundred Friends should dwell vpon:
God giue vs leysure for these rites of Loue.
Once more Adieu, be valiant, and speed well.

+RICHMOND
Good Lords conduct him to his Regiment:
Ile striue with troubled noise, to take a Nap,
Lest leaden slumber peize me downe to morrow,
When I should mount with wings of Victory:
Once more, good night kinde Lords and Gentlemen.

SD: Exeunt +DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT.Manet +RICHMOND. +RICHMOND

+RICHMOND
O thou, whose Captaine I account my selfe,
Looke on my Forces with a gracious eye:
Put in their hands thy bruising Irons of wrath,
That they may crush downe with a heauy fall,
Th'vsurping Helmets of our Aduersaries:
Make vs thy ministers of Chasticement,
That we may praise thee in thy victory:
To thee I do commend my watchfull soule,
Ere I let fall the windowes of mine eyes:
Sleeping, and waking, oh defend me still.

SD: +RICHARD starts out of his dreame.
+RICHARD
Giue me another Horse, bind vp my Wounds:
Haue mercy Iesu. Soft, I did but dreame.
O coward Conscience! how dost thou afflict me?
The Lights burne blew. It is not dead midnight.
Cold fearefull drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What? do I feare my Selfe? There's none else by,
Richard loues Richard, that is, I am I.
Is there a Murtherer heere? No; Yes, I am:
Then flye; What from my Selfe? Great reason: why?
Lest I Reuenge. What? my Selfe vpon my Selfe?
Alacke, I loue my Selfe. Wherefore? For any good
That I my Selfe, haue done vnto my Selfe?
O no. Alas, I rather hate my Selfe,
For hatefull Deeds committed by my Selfe.
I am a Vlllaine: yet I Lye, I am not.
Foole, of thy Selfe speake well: Foole, do not flatter.
My Conscience hath a thousand seuerall Tongues,
And euery Tongue brings in a seuerall Tale,
And euerie Tale condemnes me for a Villaine;
Periurie, in the high'st Degree,
Murther, sterne murther, in the dyr'st degree,
All seuerall sinnes, all vs'd in each degree,
Throng all to'th'Barre, crying all, Guilty, Guilty.
I shall dispaire, there is no Creature loues me;
And if I die, no soule shall pittie me.
Nay, wherefore should they? Since that I my Selfe,
Finde in my Selfe, no pittie to my Selfe.
Me thought, the Soules of all that I had murther'd
Came to my Tent, and euery one did threat
To morrowes vengeance on the head of Richard.
Enter Ratcliffe.

+RATCLIFFE
My Lord.

+RICHARD
Who's there?

+RATCLIFFE
Ratcliffe my Lord, 'tis I: the early Village Cock
Hath twice done salutation to the Morne,
Your Friends are vp, and buckle on their Armour.

+RICHARD
O Ratcliffe, I feare, I feare.

+RATCLIFFE
Nay good my Lord, be not affraid of Shadows.

+RICHARD
By the Apostle Paul, shadowes to night
Haue stroke more terror to the soule of Richard,
Then can the substance of ten thousand Souldiers
Armed in proofe, and led by shallow Richmond.
'Tis not yet neere day. Come go with me,
Vnder our Tents Ile play the Ease-dropper,
To heare if any meane to shrinke from me.

SD: +RICHARD exits & +RATCLIFFE exits,
SD: Enter the Lords to Richmond {+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT} sittingin his Tent.

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
Good morrow Richmond.

+RICHMOND
Cry mercy Lords, and watchfull Gentlemen,
That you haue tane a tardie sluggard heere?

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
How haue you slept my Lord?

+RICHMOND
The sweetest sleepe, / And fairest boading Dreames,
That euer entred in a drowsie head,
Haue I since your departure had my Lords.
Me thought their Soules, whose bodies Rich. murther'd,
Came to my Tent, and cried on Victory:
I promise you my Heart is very iocond,
In the remembrance of so faire a dreame,
How farre into the Morning is it Lords?

+DERBY, +OXFORD, +DORSET, +HERBERT, +BLUNT
Vpon the stroke of foure.

+RICHMOND
Why then 'tis time to Arme, and giue direction.
His Oration to his Souldiers.
More then I haue said, louing Countrymen,
The leysure and inforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell vpon: yet remember this,
God, and our good cause, fight vpon our side,
The Prayers of holy Saints and wronged soules,
Like high rear'd Bulwarkes, stand before our Faces,
(Richard except) those whom we fight against,
Had rather haue vs win, then him they follow.
For, what is he they follow? Truly Gentlemen,
A bloudy Tyrant, and a Homicide:
One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made meanes to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the meanes to help him:
A base foule Stone, made precious by the soyle
Of Englands Chaire, where he is falsely set:
One that hath euer beene Gods Enemy.
Then if you fight against Gods Enemy,
God will in iustice ward you as his Soldiers.
If you do sweare to put a Tyrant downe,
You sleepe in peace, the Tyrant being slaine:
If you do fight against your Countries Foes,
Your Countries Fat shall pay your paines the hyre.
If you do fight in safegard of your wiues,
Your wiues shall welcome home the Conquerors.
If you do free your Children from the Sword,
Your Childrens Children quits it in your Age.
Then in the name of God and all these rights,
Aduance your Standards, draw your willing Swords.
For me, the ransome of my bold attempt,
Shall be this cold Corpes on the earth's cold face.
But if I thriue, the gaine of my attempt,
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound Drummes and Trumpets boldly, and cheerefully,
God, and Saint George, Richmond, and Victory.

SD: Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe, and Catesby.

+RICHARD
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

+RATCLIFFE
That he was neuer trained vp in Armes.

+RICHARD
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

+RATCLIFFE
He smil'd and said, the better for our purpose.

+RICHARD
He was in the right, and so indeed it is.

SD: Clock strikes

Tell the clocke there. / Giue me a Kalender:
Who saw the Sunne to day?

+RATCLIFFE
N t I my Lord.

+RICHARD
Then he disdaines to shine: for by the Booke
He should haue brau'd the East an houre ago,
A blacke day will it be to somebody.
Ratcliffe.

+RATCLIFFE
My Lord.

+RICHARD
The Sun will not be seene to day,
The sky doth frowne, and lowre vpon our Army.
I would these dewy teares were from the ground.
Not shine to day? Why, what is that to me
More then to Richmond? For the selfe-same Heauen
That frownes on me, lookes sadly vpon him.
Enter Norfolke.

+NORFOLKE
Arme, arme, my Lord: the foe vaunts in the field.

+RICHARD
Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison my horse.
Call vp Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power,
I will leade forth my Soldiers to the plaine,
And thus my Battell shal be ordred.
My Foreward shall be drawne in length,
Consisting equally of Horse and Foot:
Our Archers shall be placed in the mid'st;
Iohn Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Earle of Surrey,
Shall haue the leading of the Foot and Horse.
They thus directed, we will fllow
In the maine Battell, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well-winged with our cheefest Horse:
This, and Saint George to boote. / What think'st thou Norfolke.

+NORFOLKE
A good direction warlike Soueraigne,
This found I on my Tent this Morning.

+RICHARD
*Iockey of Norfolke, be not so bold,
For Dickon thy maister is bought and sold.*
A thing deuised by the Enemy.
Go Gentlemen, euery man to his Charge,
Let not our babling Dreames affright our soules:
For Conscience is a word that Cowards vse,
Deuis'd at first to keepe the strong in awe,
Our strong armes be our Conscience, Swords our Law.
March on, ioyne brauely, let vs too't pell mell,
If not to heauen, then hand in hand to Hell.
What shall I say more then I haue inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to cope withall,
A sort of Vagabonds, Rascals, and Run-awayes,
A scum of Brittaines, and base Lackey Pezants,
Whom their o're-cloyed Country vomits forth
To desperate Aduentures, and assur'd Destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring you to vnrest:
You hauing Lands, and blest with beauteous wiues,
They would restraine the one, distaine the other,
And who doth leade them, but a paltry Fellow?
Long kept in Britaine at our Mothers cost,
A Milke-sop, one that neuer in his life
Felt so much cold, as ouer shooes in Snow:
Let's whip these straglers o're the Seas againe,
Lash hence these ouer-weening Ragges of France,
These famish'd Beggers, weary of their liues,
Who [but for dreaming on this fond exploit]
For want of meanes [poore Rats] had hang'd themselues.
If we be conquered, let men conquer vs,
And not these bastard Britaines, whom our Fathers
Haue in their owne Land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
And on Record, left them the heires of shame.
Shall these enioy our Lands? lye with our Wiues?
Rauish our daughters? Drum afarre off / Hearke, I heare their Drumme,
Right Gentlemen of England, fight boldly yeomen,
Draw Archers draw your Arrowes to the head,
Spurre your proud Horses hard, and ride in blood,
Amaze the welkin with your broken staues.
SD: Enter +FIRST MESSENGER

+RICHARD
What sayes Lord Stanley, will he bring his power?

+FIRST MESSENGER
My Lord, he doth deny to come.

+NORFOLKE
Off with his sonne Georges head.

+RICHARD
My Lord, the Enemy is past the Marsh:
After the battaile, let George Stanley dye.

+RICHARD
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
Aduance our Standards, set vpon our Foes,
Our Ancient word of Courage, faire S. George
Inspire vs with the spleene of fiery Dragons:
Vpon them, Victorie sits on our helpes.
