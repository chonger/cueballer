NS: Act 1, Scene 2

SL: A long street.

SD: Enter Belville, Melancholy, Blunt, and Frederick.

FREDERICK
Whe what the Devil ails the Coll. In a time when all the World is gay, to look like meer Lent thus? Had'st thou been long enough in Naples to have been in Love, I shou'd have sworn some such Judgment had befall'n thee.

BELVILLE
No, I have made no new Amours since I came to Naples?

FREDERICK
You have left none behind you in Paris?

BELVILLE
Neither.

FREDERICK
I cannot divine the Cause then, unless the Old Cause, the want of Money.

BLUNT
And another Old Cause, the want of a Wench— Wou'd not that revive you?

BELVILLE
You are mistaken, Ned.

BLUNT
Nay, 'Sheartlikins, then thou'rt past Cure.

FREDERICK
I have found it out; thou hast renew'd thy acquaintance with the Lady that cost thee so many sighs at the Siege of Pampulona— Pox on't, what d'e you call her—her Brother's a Noble Spaniard—Nephew to the Dead General—Florinda— Ay Florinda—and will nothing serve thy turn but that damn'd virtuous Woman? whom on my Conscience thou lovest in spight too, because thou seest little or no possibility of gaining her.

BELVILLE
Thou art mistaken, I have Int'rest enough in that lovely Virgins heart, to make me proud and vain, were it not abated by the severity of a Brother, who perceiving my happiness—

FREDERICK
Has civily forbid thee the House?

BELVILLE
'Tis so, to make way for a Pow'rful Rival, the Vice-Roy's Son, who has the advantage of me, in being a Man of Fortune, a Spaniard, and her Brother's Friend, which gives him Liberty to make his Court, whilst I have recourse only to Letters, and distant looks from her Window, which are as soft and kind
As those which Heav'n sends down on Penitents.

BLUNT
Heyday! 'Sheartlikins, simile! by this Light the Man is quite spoild.—

FREDERICK
What the Devil are we made of, that we cannot be thus concern'd for a Wench—'Sheartlikins our Cupids are like the Cooks of the Camp, they can Roast or Boil a Woman, but they have none of the fine tricks to set 'em off, no Hogoes to make the Sawce pleasant and the Stomach sharp.

FREDERICK
I dare swear I have had a hundred as young kind and handsom as this Florinda; and Dogs eat me, if they were not as troublesom to me i'th Morning, as they were welcome o're Night.

BLUNT
And yet I warrant, he wou'd not touch another Woman, if he might have her for nothing.

BELVILLE
That's thy joy, a cheap Whore.

BLUNT
Whe I 'Sheartlikins I love a Franck Soul—when did you ever hear of an honest Woman that took a Man's Money? I warrant
'em good ones—but Gentlemen, You may be free, you have been kept so poor with Parliaments and Protectors, that the little Stock you have is not worth preserving—but I thank my Stars, I had more Grace than to forfeit my Estate by Cavaliering.

BELVILLE
Methinks only following the Court, shou'd be sufficient to entitle 'em to that.

BLUNT
'Sheartlikins, they know I follow it to do it no good, unless they pick a hole in my Coat for lending you Money now and then, which is a greater Crime to my Conscience, Gentlemen, than to the Common-Wealth.

SD: Enter Willmore.

WILLMORE
Ha! dear Belvile! noble Colonel!

BELVILLE
Willmore! welcom ashore, my dear Rover!—what happy wind blew us this good Fortune?

WILLMORE
Let me salute my dear Frederick and then Command me.— How is't honest Lad?

FREDERICK
Faith, Sir, the Old Complement, infinitely the better to see my dear mad Willmore again.—Prithee why camest thou ashore? and where's the Prince?

WILLMORE
He's well, and Reigns still Lord of the watry Element. —I must abord again within a day or two, and my business ashore was only to enjoy my self a little this CarniValleria

BELVILLE
Pray know our new Friend, Sir, he's but bashful, a raw Traveller, but honest, stout, and one of us.

WILLMORE
That you esteem him, gives him an Intr'est here.

BLUNT
Your Servant, Sir.

WILLMORE
But well,—Faith I'm glad to meet you again in a warm Climate, where the kind Sun has its God-like Pow'r still over the Wine and Women—Love and Mirth! are my bus'ness in Naples, and if I mistake not the place, here's an Excellent Market for Chapmen of my humour.

BELVILLE
See, here be those kind Merchants of Love you look for.

SD: Enter several Men in Masquing Habits, some playing on Musique, others dancing after, Women drest like Courtizans, with Papers pinn'd on their Breasts, and Baskets of Flowers in their Hands.

BLUNT
'Sheartlikins, what have we here?

FREDERICK
Now the game begins.

WILLMORE
Fine pretty creatures! May a stranger have leave to look and love?—What's here—Roses for every moneth?

SD: [Reads the Papers.

BLUNT
Roses for every moneth? What means that?

BELVILLE
They are, or wou'd have you think they're courtizans, who here in Naples, are to be hir'd by the moneth.

WILLMORE
Kind, and obliging to inform us—Pray where do these roses grow? I wou'd fain plant some of 'em in a bed of mine.

WOMAN
Beware such roses, Sir.

WILLMORE
A pox of fear: I'll be bak't with thee between a pair of sheets, and that's they proper still; so I might but strew such Roses over me, and under me—Fair one, Wou'd you wou'd give me leave to gather at your bush this idle moneth; I wou'd go near to make some body smell of it all the year after.

BELVILLE
And thou hast need of such a remedy, for thou stink'st of tar and ropes ends, like a dock or pest-house.

SD: [The Woman puts herself into the Hands of a Man, and Exits.

WILLMORE
Nay, nay, you shall not leave me so.

BELVILLE
By all means use no violence here.

WILLMORE
Death! Just as I was going to be damnably in love, to have her led off! I could pluck that rose out of his hand, and even kiss the bed, the bush grew in.

FREDERICK
No friend to love, like a long voyage at sea.

BLUNT
Except a nunnery, Frederick

WILLMORE
Death! But will they not be kind? Quickly be kind? Thou know'st I'm no tame sigher, but a rampant lion of the forrest.

SD: Advances from the farther end of the Scenes, two Men drest all over with horns of several sorts, making grimaces at one another, with papers pinn'd on their backs.

BELVILLE
Oh the fantastical rogues, how they'r drest! 'Tis a satyre against the whole sex.

WILLMORE
'Is this a fruit that grows in this warm countrey?

BELVILLE
Yes: 'Tis pretty to see these Italians start, swell and stab, at the word cuckold; and yet stumble at horns on every threshold.

WILLMORE
See what's on their back—Flowers of every Night.

SD: [Reads.

WILLMORE
—Ah Rogue! and more sweet than roses of ev'ry moneth! This is a gardiner of Adam's own breeding.

SD: [They dance.

BELVILLE
What think you of those grave People?
—is a wake in Essex half so mad or Extravagant?

WILLMORE
I like their sober grave way, 'tis a kind of legal authoriz'd fornication, where the men are not chid for't, nor the women despis'd, as amongst our dull English, even the monsieurs want that part of good manners.

BELVILLE
But here in Italy, a monsieur is the humblest best bred gentleman—duels are so bafled by Bravo's, that an age shews not one but between a French-man, and a hang-man, who is as much too hard for him on the Piaza, as they are for a Dutchman on the New Bridge—but see another crew.

SD: Enter Florinda, Hellena and Valeria, drest like Gipsies; Callis and Stephano, Lucetta, Philipo and Sancho in Masquerade.

HELLENA
Sister, there's your English Man, and with him a handsome proper fellow—I'le to him, and instead of telling him his Fortune, try my own.

WILLMORE
Gipsies on my life—sure these will prattle if a man crosse their hands.

SD: [Goes to Hellena.

WILLMORE
—dear, pretty, (and I hope) young Devil, will you tell an amorous stranger, what luck he's like to have?

HELLENA
Have a care how you venture with me Sir, least I pick your pocket, which will more vex your English humour, than an Italian fortune will please you.

WILLMORE
How the Devil cam'st thou to know my countrey and humour?

HELLENA
The first I guess by a certain forward impudence, which does not displease me at this time, and the loss of your money will vex you, because I hope you have but very little to lose.

WILLMORE
Egad child thou'rt ith' right, it is so little, I dare not offer it thee for a kindness—but cannot you divine what other things of more value I have about me, that I wou'd more willingly part with.

HELLENA
Indeed no, that's the bus'ness of a witch, and I am but a gipsie yet.—Yet without looking in your hand, I have a parlous guess, 'tis some foolish heart you mean, an inconstantEnglish heart, as little worth stealing as your purse.

WILLMORE
Nay, then thou dost deal with the Devil, that's certain.— thou hast guest as right, as if thou had'st been one of
that number it has languisht for.—I find you'l be better acquainted with it, nor can you take it in a better time; for I am come from sea, child, and Venus not being propitious to me in her own element: I have a world of love in store—wou'd you wou'd be good natur'd and take some on't off my hands.

HELLENA
Whe—I cou'd be inclin'd that way—but for a foolish vow I am going to make—to dye a maid.

WILLMORE
Then thou art damn'd without redemption, and as I am a good Christian, I ought in charity to divert so wicked a design —therefore prithee dear creature let me know quickly when, and where I shall begin to set a helping hand to so good a work.

HELLENA
If you shou'd prevail with my tender heart (as I begin to fear you will, for you have horrible loving eyes) there will be difficulty in't, that you'l hardly undergo for my sake.

WILLMORE
Faith child I have been bred in dangers, and wear a sword, that has been employ'd in a worse cause, than for a handsome kind woman—name the danger—let it be any thing but a long siege—and I'le undertake it.

HELLENA
Can you storm?

WILLMORE
Oh most furiously.

HELLENA
What think you of a Nunnery Wall? For he that wins me, must gain that first.

WILLMORE
A nun! Oh how I love thee for't! There's no sinner like a young Saint—nay now there's no denying me, the Old Law had no curse (to a woman) like dying a maid; witness Ieptha'sdaughter.

HELLENA
A very good text this, if well handled, and I perceive Father Captain, you wou'd impose no severe penance on her who were inclin'd to console her self, before she took orders.

WILLMORE
If she be young and handsome.

HELLENA
Ay there's it—but if she be not—

WILLMORE
By this hand, child, I have an implicit faith, and dare venture on thee with all faults—besides, 'tis more meritorious to leave the world, when thou hast tasted and prov'd the pleasure on't. Then 'twill be a virtue in thee, which now will be pure ignorance.

HELLENA
I perceive good Father Captain, you design only to make me fit for Heaven—but if on the contrary, you shou'd quite divert me from it, and bring me back to the world again, I shou'd have a new man to seek I find; and what a grief that
will be—for when I begin, I fancy I shall love like any thing, I never try'd yet.

WILLMORE
Egad and that's kind—prithee dear creature, give me credit for a heart, for faith I'm a very honest fellow—Oh, I long to come first to the Banquet of Love! And such a swinging appetite I bring—Oh I'm impatient.—thy lodging sweetheart, thy lodging! or I'm a dead man!

HELLENA
Why must we be either guilty of fornication or murder if we converse with you men—and is there no difference between leave to love me, and leave to lie with me?

WILLMORE
Faith child they were made to go together.

LUCETTA
Are you sure this is the man?

SD: [Pointing to Blunt

SANCHO
When did I mistake your game?

LUCETTA
This is a stranger, I know by his gazing; if he be brisk, he'l venture to follow me; and then if I understand my trade, he's mine, he's English too; and they say that's a sort of good natur'd loving people, and have generally so kind an opinion of themselves, that a woman with any wit may flatter e'm into any sort of fool she pleases.

BLUNT
'Tis so—she is taken— I have Beauties which my false Glass at home did not discover.

SD: She often passes by Blunt and gazes on him, he struts and Cocks, and walks and gazes on her.

FLORINDA
This Woman watches me so, I shall get no opportunity to discover my self to him, and so miss the intent of my coming —but as I was saying, Sir,—by this Line you shou'd be a Lover.

SD: [Looking in his hand.

BELVILLE
I thought how right you guessed, all men are in Love, or pretend to be so—come let me go, I'm weary of this fooling.

SD: [Walks away.

FLORINDA
I will not, till you have confest whether the passion that you have vow'd Florinda, be true or false?

SD: She holds him, he strives to get from her.

BELVILLE
Florinda!

SD: [Turns quick towards her.

FLORINDA
Softly.

BELVILLE
Thou hast nam'd one will fix me here for ever.

FLORINDA
She'll be disappointed then, who expects you this night at the Garden-gate, and if you fail not—as let me see the other hand—you will go near to do—she vows to dye or make you happy.

SD: [Looks on Callis who observes 'em.

BELVILLE
What canst thou mean?

FLORINDA
That which I say—Farewel.

BELVILLE
Oh charming Sybil stay, complete that joy which as it is will turn into destraction!—where must I be? at the Garden-gate? I know it—at Night you say?—I'll sooner forfeit Heav'n than disobey.

SD: Enter Don Pedro and other Masquers, and pass over the Stage.

CALLIS
Madam, your Brother's here.

FLORINDA
Take this to instruct you farther.

SD: [Gives him a Letter, and goes off.

FREDERICK
Have a care, Sir, what you promise; this may be a Trap laid by her Brother to ruine you.

BELVILLE
Do not disturb my happiness with doubts.

SD: [Opens the Letter.

WILLMORE
My dear pretty Creature, a Thousand Blessings on thee! still in this habit you say?—and after Dinner at this place.

HELLENA
Yes, if you will swear to keep your heart, and not bestow it between this and that.

WILLMORE
By all the little Gods of Love I swear, I'l leave it with you, and if you run away with it, those Deities of Justice will revenge me.

SD: [Ex. all the Women.

FREDERICK
Do you know the hand?

BELVILLE
'Tis Florinda's.

WILLMORE
All Blessings fall upon the virtuous Maid.

FREDERICK
Nay, no Idolatry, a sober Sacrifice I'l allow you.

BELVILLE
Oh Friends, the welcom'st News! the softest Letter!— nay—you shall all see it! and cou'd you now be serious, I might be made the happiest Man the Sun shines on!

WILLMORE
The reason of this mighty joy?

BELVILLE
See how kindly she invites me to deliver her from the threatned violence of her Brother—will you not assist me?

WILLMORE
I know not what thou mean'st, but I'll make one at any mischief where a Woman's concerned—but she'l be grateful to us for the favour, will she not?

BELVILLE
How mean you?

WILLMORE
How shou'd I mean? thou know'st there's but one way for a Woman to oblige me.

BELVILLE
Do not prophane—the Maid is nicely virtuous.

WILLMORE
Who Pox, then she's fit for nothing but a husband, let her e'n go, Colonel.

FREDERICK
Peace, she's the Colonel's Mistris, Sir.

WILLMORE
Let her be the Devil, if she be thy Mistris, I'l serve her— name the way.

BELVILLE
Read here this Postscript.

WILLMORE
SD: [Reads.]

WILLMORE
—Kind Heart, if we Three cannot weave a string to let her down a Garden-Wall, 'twere pity but the Hang-man wove one for us all.
At Ten at night—at the Garden-Gate—of which, if I cannot get the Key, I will contrive a way over the Wall—come attended with a Friend or Two.

FREDERICK
Let her alone for that, your Womans wit! your fair kind Woman! will out-trick a Broker or a Jew: and contrive like a Jesuit in Chains—but see, Ned Blunt is stolen out after the Lure of a Damsel.

SD: [Ex. Blunt and Lucetta.

BELVILLE
So, he'll scarce find his way home again, unless we get him cry'd by the Bell-man in the Market-place, and 'twou'd sound prettily—a lost English Boy of Thirty.

FREDERICK
I hope 'tis some Common crafty Sinner, one that will fit him; it may be she'll sell him for Perue, the Rogue's sturdy, and wou'd work well in a Mine; at least I hope she'll dress him for our Mirth, cheat him of all, then have him well-favourd'ly bang'd, and turn'd out Naked at Midnight.

WILLMORE
Prithee what humour is he of, that you wish him so well?

BELVILLE
Why of an English Elder Brother's humour, Educated in a Nursery, with a Maid to tend him till Fifteen, and lyes with his Grand-Mother till he's of Age: one that knowes no pleasure beyond riding to the next Fair, or going up to London with his right Worshipful Father in Parliament-time; wearing gay Cloths, or making honourable Love to his Lady Mothers Landry-Maid: gets drunk at a Hunting-Match, and ten to one then gives some proofs of his Prowess.—A Pox upon him, he's our Banker, and has all our Cash about him, and if he fail, we are all Broke.

FREDERICK
Oh let him alone for that matter, he's of a damn'd stingey quality, that will secure our stock; I know not in what danger it were indeed if the Jilt shou'd pretend she's in Love with him, for 'tis a kind believing Coxcomb; otherwise if he part with more than a piece of Eight—-gueld him: for which offer he may chance to be beaten, if she be a Whore of the First Rank.

BELVILLE
Nay the Rogue will not be easily beaten, he's stout enough; perhaps if they talk beyond his capacity, he may chance to exercise his Courage upon some of them, else I'm sure they'll find it as difficult to beat as to please him.

WILLMORE
'Tis a luckey Devil to light upon so kind a Wench!

FREDERICK
Thou had'st a great deal of talk with thy little Gipsie, coud'st thou do no good upon her? for mine was hard-hearted.

WILLMORE
Hang her, she was some damn'd honest Person of Quality I'm sure, she was so very free and witty. If her face be but answerable to her Witt, and humour, I wou'd be bound to Constancy this Moneth to gain her—in the mean time, have you made no kind acquaintance since you came to Town?—you do not use to be honest so long, Gentlemen.

FREDERICK
Faith Love has kept us honest, we have been all fir'd with a Beauty newly come to Town, the Famous Paduana Angellica Bianca.

WILLMORE
What the Mistris of the dead Spanish General?

BELVILLE
Yes, she's now the only ador'd Beauty of all the Youth in Naples, who put on all their Charms to appear lovely in her sight, their Coaches, Liveries, and themselves, all gay, as on a Monarch's Birth-Day, to attract the Eyes of this fair Charmer, while she has the pleasure to behold all languish for her that see her.

FREDERICK
'Tis pretty to see with how much Love the Men regard her, and how much Envy the Women.

WILLMORE
What Gallant has she?

BELVILLE
None, she's expos'd to Sail, and Four days in the Week she's yours—for so much a Month.

WILLMORE
The very thought of it quenches all manner of Fire in me—yet prithee let's see her.

BELVILLE
Let's first to Dinner, and after that wee'l pass the day as you please—but at Night yee must all be at my Devotion.

WILLMORE
I will not fail you.

SD: The End of the First Act.
