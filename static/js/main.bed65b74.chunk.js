Alas! Too soon\nWe came aboard.\nA league from Epidamium had we sail\u2019d\nBefore the always-wind-obeying deep\nGave any tragic instance of our harm:\nBut longer did we not retain much hope;\nFor what obscured light the heavens did grant\nDid but convey unto our fearful minds\nA doubtful warrant of immediate death,\nWhich though myself would gladly have embrac\u2019d,\nYet the incessant weepings of my wife,\nWeeping before for what she saw must come,\nAnd piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\nThat mourn\u2019d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\nForc\u2019d me to seek delays for them and me.\nAnd this it was (for other means was none):\nThe sailors sought for safety by our boat,\nAnd left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.\nMy wife, more careful for the latter-born,\nHad fast\u2019ned him unto a small spare mast,\nSuch as sea-faring men provide for storms;\nTo him one of the other twins was bound,\nWhilst I had been like heedful of the other.\nThe children thus dispos\u2019d, my wife and I,\nFixing our eyes on whom our care was fix\u2019d,\nFast\u2019ned ourselves at either end the mast,\nAnd floating straight, obedient to the stream,\nWas carried towards Corinth, as we thought.\nAt length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\nDispers\u2019d those vapors that offended us,\nAnd by the benefit of his wished light\nThe seas wax\u2019d calm, and we discovered\nTwo ships from far, making amain to us,\nOf Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.\nBut ere they came\u2014O, let me say no more!\nGather the sequel by that went before.\n\nSOLINUS, DUKE OF EPHESUS\nNay, forward, old man, do not break off so,\nFor we may pity, though not pardon thee.\n\nEGEON\nO, had the gods done so, I had not now\nWorthily term\u2019d them merciless to us!\nFor ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\nWe were encount\u2019red by a mighty rock,\nWhich being violently borne upon,\nOur helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\nSo that, in this unjust divorce of us,\nFortune had left to both of us alike\nWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.\nHer part, poor soul!
